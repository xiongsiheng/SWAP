{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the continuity of a piecewise function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Continuity:** A function is continuous at a point if the limit of the function at that point equals the function value at that point. For piecewise functions, this means ensuring that the function values match at the boundaries between different pieces.\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions:** At the boundaries where the pieces meet (in this case, at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\)), the function values from the left-hand piece and the right-hand piece must be equal to ensure continuity.\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the boundary conditions to set up equations that relate the parameters (in this case, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)) to the function values at the boundaries. For example, at \\( x = 2 \\), the value from the middle piece \\( x - 5 \\) should equal the value from the right piece \\( ax + 3 \\).\n\n4. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Solve the equations derived from the boundary conditions to find the values of the parameters. Ensure that you solve these equations accurately, as errors here can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you have found the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), substitute them back into the function to verify that the function is indeed continuous at the boundaries. This step helps catch any errors made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while ensuring the continuity of piecewise functions."}
