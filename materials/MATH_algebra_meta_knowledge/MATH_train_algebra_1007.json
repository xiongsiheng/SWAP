{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Inequality:** Ensure you fully understand the structure of the inequality. Identify the terms that depend on \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), and how they interact.\n\n2. **Simplifying Rational Expressions:** When dealing with rational expressions, simplify both the numerator and the denominator separately before combining them. This can help in identifying common factors and simplifying the inequality.\n\n3. **Analyzing for All \\( q > 0 \\):** Since the inequality must hold for every \\( q > 0 \\), consider the behavior of the inequality as \\( q \\) approaches zero and as \\( q \\) becomes very large. This can help in determining constraints on \\( p \\).\n\n4. **Testing Boundary Conditions:** Test the boundary conditions and critical points of \\( p \\) (e.g., when \\( p = 0 \\)) to understand how the inequality behaves at these points.\n\n5. **Using Algebraic Manipulation:** Use algebraic manipulation techniques such as multiplying both sides by the same positive expression (since \\( q > 0 \\)) to clear out the denominator and simplify the inequality.\n\n6. **Checking for Consistency:** Ensure that any solution you derive is consistent with the requirement that the inequality holds for all \\( q > 0 \\). This involves verifying that the inequality does not break down for any specific value of \\( q \\).\n\n7. **Expressing in Interval Notation:** When expressing your answer in interval notation, ensure that the intervals are correctly formatted and that they accurately reflect the solution set for \\( p \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
