{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** Ensure you correctly substitute the given value (in this case, \\( x = 2 \\)) into each function. Pay close attention to operations involving fractions and powers.\n\n2. **Algebraic Manipulation:** When solving for a variable (here, \\( k \\)), ensure that you correctly isolate the variable by performing the necessary algebraic operations. This includes correctly handling addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with multiple steps or complex expressions. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand what the problem is asking. Here, you need to find \\( k \\) such that the difference between the evaluated functions at \\( x = 2 \\) equals 2. This understanding helps in setting up the correct equation.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding \\( k \\), substitute it back into the functions to verify that \\( f(2) - g(2) = 2 \\). This step ensures that your solution is correct and catches any errors made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
