{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** Clearly understand the function's definition and how it operates on even and odd numbers. Remember that for even numbers, the function divides by 2, and for odd numbers, it multiplies by 3 and adds 1.\n\n2. **Sequential Application:** Apply the function step by step, starting from the innermost application and moving outward. This helps in tracking the transformations accurately.\n\n3. **Odd and Even Identification:** Accurately identify whether the number is odd or even at each step to apply the correct part of the function definition.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure precise arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying by 3 and adding 1, as these steps can introduce errors if not handled carefully.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify intermediate steps by manually checking the transformations to ensure they align with the function's rules.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
