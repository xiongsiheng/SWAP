{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving the greatest integer function (floor function), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:** Ensure you correctly interpret the floor function, which rounds down to the nearest integer less than or equal to the given number.\n\n2. **Identifying Solutions:** Recognize that the equation \\( x - \\lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{1}{\\lfloor x \rfloor} \\) implies that \\( x \\) must be a number between two consecutive integers, say \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer. This is because \\( x - \\lfloor x \rfloor \\) represents the fractional part of \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** For each integer \\( n \\), set \\( x \\) in the interval \\( [n, n+1) \\) and solve \\( x - n = \frac{1}{n} \\). This simplifies to \\( x = n + \frac{1}{n} \\).\n\n4. **Finding Smallest Positive Solutions:** Start with the smallest positive integers for \\( n \\) and calculate \\( x \\) until you find the required number of solutions.\n\n5. **Summing Solutions:** When summing the solutions, ensure you correctly add both the integer and fractional parts of each solution.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check each step, especially the calculation of \\( x \\) and the summation, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving the greatest integer function."}
