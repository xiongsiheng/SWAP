{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\(a\\) that ensures the continuity of the piecewise function \\(f(x)\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Continuity:** A function is continuous at a point \\(x = c\\) if the limit of the function as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) from both sides is equal to the function value at \\(c\\). For piecewise functions, this typically means ensuring that the function values from both pieces match at the point where the definition changes.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find \\(a\\), set the expressions from both pieces of the function equal to each other at the point where the definition changes (in this case, at \\(x = 3\\)). This ensures that the function does not have a jump or break at that point.\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute \\(x = 3\\) into both pieces of the function and set the resulting expressions equal to each other. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Checking Your Answer:** After finding \\(a\\), verify that the function is indeed continuous at \\(x = 3\\) by substituting \\(a\\) back into the function and ensuring that both pieces yield the same value at \\(x = 3\\).\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving for \\(a\\) in piecewise continuous functions."}
