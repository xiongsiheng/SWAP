{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to find the length of the side of the square. The distance formula between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Square of the Side:** Once you have the length of the side, square it to find the area of the square. The area \\(A\\) of a square with side length \\(s\\) is \\(A = s^2\\).\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that you perform all calculations accurately, especially when squaring numbers or taking square roots, as these operations can introduce errors if not done carefully.\n\n4. **Check for Consistency:** If possible, verify your calculations by checking if the side length you found could indeed form a square with the given points, considering the properties of a square (equal sides and right angles).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
