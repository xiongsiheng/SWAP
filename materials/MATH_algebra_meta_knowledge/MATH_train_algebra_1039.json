{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value equation $|x + 5| = 20$ means that $x + 5$ can be either 20 or -20. This leads to two separate equations: $x + 5 = 20$ and $x + 5 = -20$.\n\n2. **Solving Linear Equations:** Solve each equation separately to find the values of $x$. For $x + 5 = 20$, subtract 5 from both sides to get $x = 15$. For $x + 5 = -20$, add 25 to both sides to get $x = -25$.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:** To find the positive difference between the two solutions, subtract the smaller value from the larger value. In this case, subtract $-25$ from $15$ to get $40$.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic when solving for $x$ and when calculating the difference to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Ensuring Positivity:** Always ensure that the difference calculated is positive, as the problem specifies the 'positive difference'.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
