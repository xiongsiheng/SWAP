{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Definitions:** Ensure you fully understand the definitions and properties of the custom operation given. In this case, the operation $\\#$ has specific conditions that must be applied consistently.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for patterns in the given conditions. For example, the condition $(r + 1)\\ \\#\\ s = (r\\ \\#\\ s) + s + 1$ suggests a recursive or incremental pattern that might help in deriving the value of specific instances of the operation.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Identity:** Utilize the symmetric property $r\\ \\#\\ s = s\\ \\#\\ r$ and the identity property $r\\ \\#\\ 0 = r$. These can simplify the process of finding the value of $11\\ \\#\\ 5$ by reducing the complexity or by providing a starting point.\n\n4. **Recursive Application:** Apply the conditions recursively, starting from simpler cases (like $r\\ \\#\\ 0$) and building up to the desired operation. This can help in understanding how the operation evolves with different inputs.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you derive a value for $11\\ \\#\\ 5$, verify it by checking if it satisfies all the given conditions. This step ensures that the solution is consistent with the defined properties of the operation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
