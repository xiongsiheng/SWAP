{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding and Simplifying:** When dealing with polynomial equations, ensure you expand and simplify correctly. For example, \\((x+2)(x-3)\\) expands to \\(x^2 - x - 6\\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Remember the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). This formula helps find the roots of the equation.\n\n3. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\). This shortcut can be useful for finding the sum of the solutions without needing to solve for each root individually.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions you find satisfy the original equation. Sometimes, algebraic manipulations can introduce solutions that do not fit the original problem.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients during calculations to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
