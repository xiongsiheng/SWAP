{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying expressions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly by multiplying each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. This ensures all terms are accounted for.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding the binomials, combine like terms carefully. This involves adding or subtracting coefficients of terms with the same variable and exponent.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) strictly. Perform multiplication before subtraction, and ensure all multiplications are completed before combining like terms.\n\n4. **Attention to Signs:** Pay close attention to the signs of each term, especially when subtracting the second expanded binomial from the first. Incorrect handling of signs can lead to significant errors.\n\n5. **Simplification Check:** After simplifying, double-check the expression to ensure no terms have been omitted or incorrectly combined. This step helps catch any oversights in the simplification process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying such expressions."}
