{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the minimum value of a quadratic function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** The minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula \\(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\\).\n\n2. **Quadratic Coefficients:** Identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly from the quadratic expression. Misidentifying these can lead to incorrect calculations.\n\n3. **Substitution:** Once you find the x-coordinate of the vertex, substitute it back into the original quadratic function to find the corresponding y-value, which gives the minimum or maximum value.\n\n4. **Sign of \\(a\\):** Remember that if \\(a\\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex represents the minimum point. If \\(a\\) is negative, the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex represents the maximum point.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with fractions or decimals, as small errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the minimum value of a quadratic function."}
