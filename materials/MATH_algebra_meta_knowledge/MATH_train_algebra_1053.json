{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perimeter and Area:** Recall the formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by \\( P = 2 \times (length + width) \\), and the area \\( A \\) is given by \\( A = length \times width \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the given information into mathematical equations. In this case, you know the perimeter is 60 feet and the length is twice the width. Set up these relationships as equations.\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Use the equations to solve for the length and width. Start by expressing the length in terms of the width and then substitute into the perimeter equation to solve for the width.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy. Simple calculation errors can lead to incorrect dimensions.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have the dimensions, calculate the area and verify that it makes sense given the constraints of the problem. This step ensures that your solution is both mathematically correct and logically consistent with the problem's conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
