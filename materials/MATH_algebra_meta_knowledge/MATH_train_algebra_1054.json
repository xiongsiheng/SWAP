{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating a function at a specific value, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value correctly into the function. For example, if the function is \\( f(x) = x^2 - x \\) and you need to find \\( f(4) \\), substitute 4 for \\( x \\) in the function.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression. This means you should square the value first, then subtract the value from the squared result.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with integers, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the operations, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating functions at specific values."}
