{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the valid side lengths for a triangle, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem:** This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. For sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), this means \\(a + b > c\\), \\(a + c > b\\), and \\(b + c > a\\).\n\n2. **Applying the Theorem:** In your problem, set \\(a = 7\\), \\(b = 10\\), and \\(c = x^2\\). You need to check the inequalities: \\(7 + 10 > x^2\\), \\(7 + x^2 > 10\\), and \\(10 + x^2 > 7\\).\n\n3. **Solving the Inequalities:** Solve each inequality for \\(x\\) to find the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy all three conditions.\n\n4. **Integer Solutions:** Once you have the range of \\(x\\) values, identify the positive integer values within that range.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the application of the triangle inequality theorem to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points will help you correctly determine the valid side lengths for the triangle."}
