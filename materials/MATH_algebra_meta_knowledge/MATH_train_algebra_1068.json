{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Factoring:** Understand that for a quadratic equation \\(x^2 + tx - 10\\) to be factored as \\((x+a)(x+b)\\), the product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must equal the constant term (-10), and their sum must equal the coefficient of the linear term (\\(t\\)).\n\n2. **Integer Pairs:** Identify all pairs of integers \\((a, b)\\) that multiply to -10. These pairs are \\((1, -10), (-1, 10), (2, -5), (-2, 5), (10, -1), (-10, 1), (5, -2), (-5, 2)\\).\n\n3. **Sum Calculation:** Calculate the sum \\(a + b\\) for each pair to find the corresponding \\(t\\) values.\n\n4. **Product of Constants:** Once you have identified all possible \\(t\\) values, find the product of these values to get the final answer. Ensure you multiply all values correctly to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify by expanding the factored form \\((x+a)(x+b)\\) to ensure it matches the original quadratic \\(x^2 + tx - 10\\), though this step is more about confirming the factoring process rather than reducing errors in the final product calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
