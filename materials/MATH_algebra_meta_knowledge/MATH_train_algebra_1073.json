{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring polynomials like this one, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Start by identifying the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients and the variable terms. For example, in \\(58x^5 - 203x^{11}\\), the GCF of the coefficients 58 and 203 is 29, and the GCF of the variable terms \\(x^5\\) and \\(x^{11}\\) is \\(x^5\\).\n\n2. **Factor Out the GCF:** Once you've identified the GCF, factor it out of each term. This means dividing each term by the GCF and writing the GCF outside the parentheses.\n\n3. **Check Your Work:** After factoring, multiply the terms back together to ensure that you return to the original polynomial. This step helps verify that your factoring was correct.\n\n4. **Simplify Remaining Expressions:** If there are any remaining expressions inside the parentheses that can be factored further, continue to factor them.\n\n5. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as incorrect division or multiplication, especially when dealing with exponents. Double-check your arithmetic to avoid these errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while factoring polynomials."}
