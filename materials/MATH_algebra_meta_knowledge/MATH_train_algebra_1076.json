{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Graph Interpretation:** Accurately interpret the graph to determine the function values at specific points. Ensure you are reading the correct y-values corresponding to the given x-values.\n\n2. **Symmetry and Periodicity:** Check if the function exhibits symmetry (even or odd) or periodicity, which can simplify the calculation of sums or differences of function values at symmetric points.\n\n3. **Precision in Reading Graphs:** Use the grid lines and tick marks on the graph to read values as precisely as possible. Avoid rounding or estimating values unless necessary.\n\n4. **Verification of Calculations:** Double-check the addition of the function values to ensure no arithmetic errors are made during the calculation.\n\n5. **Understanding of Function Behavior:** Understand the general behavior of the function, such as whether it is increasing, decreasing, or oscillating, which can help in predicting and verifying the sum of function values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
