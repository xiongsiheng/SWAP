{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Properties:** Understand the properties of absolute values, such as $|a| = a$ if $a \\geq 0$ and $|a| = -a$ if $a < 0$. This is crucial for correctly splitting the equation into two cases.\n\n2. **Case Analysis:** When dealing with absolute values, you typically need to consider two cases: one where the expression inside the absolute value is non-negative and one where it is negative. Solve the equation for each case separately.\n\n3. **Consistency Check:** After solving for each case, ensure that the solutions are consistent with the assumptions made for each case. For example, if you assumed $y - 6 \\geq 0$, then the solution $y$ must satisfy this condition.\n\n4. **Substitution Verification:** Always substitute your final answers back into the original equation to verify that they satisfy the equation. This step is essential to catch any errors in the case analysis or in the algebraic manipulations.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when combining terms and solving linear equations, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
