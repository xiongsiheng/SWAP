{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** Recall that for a quadratic equation \\(x^2 - mx + 2 = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(a + b = m\\) and the product of the roots \\(ab = 2\\).\n\n2. **Roots of New Equation:** Understand that for the new quadratic equation \\(x^2 - px + q = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(a + \frac{1}{b} + b + \frac{1}{a} = p\\) and the product of the roots \\(\\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\\left(b + \frac{1}{a}\right) = q\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** Be meticulous when simplifying expressions involving reciprocals and sums of roots. For example, \\(\\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\\left(b + \frac{1}{a}\right)\\) can be expanded carefully to ensure no terms are overlooked.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** Use the known values of \\(a + b\\) and \\(ab\\) to substitute and simplify expressions for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Always verify your final value of \\(q\\) by ensuring it fits the context of the original problem.\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Common errors include misapplying Vieta's formulas or incorrectly handling reciprocals. Double-check each step to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
