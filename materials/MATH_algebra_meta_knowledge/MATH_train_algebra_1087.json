{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Composition of Functions:** When dealing with compositions of functions like \\( g(x) = f(f(f(f(x)))) \\), understand that each application of \\( f \\) transforms the input \\( x \\) through the function's operation. For example, \\( f(x) = 3x - 2 \\) will triple the input and subtract 2 each time it is applied.\n\n2. **Tracking Transformations:** Keep track of how each application of \\( f \\) affects the range of \\( x \\). Start with the given domain \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\) and apply \\( f \\) repeatedly to see how the values transform.\n\n3. **Calculating the Range:** Calculate the range of \\( g \\) by determining the minimum and maximum values of \\( g(x) \\) over the given domain. This involves applying \\( f \\) multiple times and observing the resulting values.\n\n4. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved in each function application, as errors in calculation can significantly affect the range.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the range, verify your results by checking if the computed range values are consistent with the transformations applied by the function \\( f \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving the range of composite functions."}
