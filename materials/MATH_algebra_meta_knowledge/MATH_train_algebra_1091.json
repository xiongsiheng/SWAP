{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), which is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). Ensure you correctly apply this formula for each pair of points.\n\n2. **Simplifying Square Roots:** When you encounter expressions involving square roots, simplify them carefully. For example, if you have \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), ensure that you correctly identify and simplify any perfect squares within the expression.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when squaring numbers or adding/subtracting under the square root. Small arithmetic errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n4. **Verification of Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for each distance computation to ensure accuracy. This step is crucial as it directly impacts the sum of distances.\n\n5. **Understanding Fermat Point:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of the Fermat point, which minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices of a triangle. This understanding can help you verify if your guessed point is reasonable.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
