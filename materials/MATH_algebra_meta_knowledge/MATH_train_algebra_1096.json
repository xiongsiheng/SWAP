{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Recall that if two terms are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. In this case, the product of each term and the term preceding it is the same constant.\n\n2. **Identifying the Constant:** Calculate the constant of proportionality by multiplying the first term by the second term. This constant will remain the same for all pairs of consecutive terms.\n\n3. **Recursive Formula:** Develop a recursive formula for the sequence based on the inverse proportionality relationship. For example, if the \\(n\\)-th term is \\(a_n\\), then \\(a_{n+1} = \frac{k}{a_n}\\), where \\(k\\) is the constant of proportionality.\n\n4. **Sequence Calculation:** Use the recursive formula to calculate each subsequent term in the sequence up to the 12th term. Ensure you are correctly applying the formula for each step.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify the pattern by calculating a few more terms manually to ensure the recursive formula is correctly applied. This can help catch any errors in the sequence calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
