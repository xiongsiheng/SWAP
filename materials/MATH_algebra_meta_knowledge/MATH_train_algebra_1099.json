{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand that you need to maximize the sum of four products formed by pairing four given numbers in different ways.\n\n2. **Pairing Strategy:** To maximize the sum of products, pair the largest numbers together in the products. This is based on the principle that the product of larger numbers tends to yield a larger result.\n\n3. **Systematic Approach:** Use a systematic approach to try different combinations of pairings. Start by pairing the largest numbers and then proceed to see how different pairings affect the total sum.\n\n4. **Verification of Combinations:** After calculating the sum for a particular pairing, verify if there are other possible pairings that might yield a higher sum. This ensures that you explore all potential combinations.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the details of each pairing and calculation to avoid simple arithmetic errors that can significantly affect the outcome.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure a more accurate solution to the problem."}
