{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Square Roots:** Recognize that the square root function is increasing, meaning if \\(a \\le b\\), then \\(\\sqrt{a} \\le \\sqrt{b}\\). This property is crucial when comparing expressions under square roots.\n\n2. **Squaring Inequalities:** When you square both sides of an inequality, you must ensure that both sides are non-negative before doing so. If one side could be negative, you need to consider the implications of that.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** Inequalities involving quadratic expressions often require finding the roots of the quadratic equation and determining where the quadratic expression is positive or negative. Use the roots to divide the number line into intervals and test each interval.\n\n4. **Integer Solutions:** When looking for integer solutions, especially in the context of inequalities, systematically test integer values within the range determined by the inequality to ensure no integers are missed.\n\n5. **Double-Check Boundaries:** Pay special attention to the boundaries of the inequality, as these are often where the integer solutions lie. Ensure that you correctly interpret and apply the strict or non-strict nature of the inequality signs.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
