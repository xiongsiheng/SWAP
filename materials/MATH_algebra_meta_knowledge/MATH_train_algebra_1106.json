{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Consecutive Numbers:** Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order, such as \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\). In this case, the product of two consecutive numbers \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) is given.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Formulate the equation based on the given product. For example, if \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) are the consecutive numbers, then \\( n(n+1) = 18{,}360 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form \\( n^2 + n - 18{,}360 = 0 \\). Solve for \\( n \\) using methods like factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Checking for Real Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions for \\( n \\) are real and positive integers, as page numbers cannot be negative or non-integer values.\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:** Once you have the correct value of \\( n \\), find the sum of \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\), which is simply \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and ensure that the product of the two numbers indeed equals 18,360. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
