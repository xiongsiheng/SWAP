{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the absolute value of the difference of the solutions of a quadratic equation like \\(x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0\\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots of the equation. Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\), and \\(c = 5\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant:** Calculate the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) to ensure the equation has real solutions. For this equation, \\(\\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5 = 25 - 20 = 5\\), which is positive, indicating two real solutions.\n\n3. **Roots Calculation:** Accurately compute the roots using the quadratic formula. The roots are \\(x_1 = \frac{5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\) and \\(x_2 = \frac{5 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Difference of Roots:** Find the difference between the two roots, \\(x_1 - x_2 = \\left(\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - \\left(\frac{5 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n5. **Absolute Value:** Since the difference \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) is already positive, its absolute value is simply \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations for the roots and the difference to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors in solving this type of problem."}
