{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation:** Start by rearranging the equation to set it to zero. For example, if you have \\(x^2 - 5x + 5 = 9\\), rewrite it as \\(x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to find the roots of the equation. Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Checking for Real Roots:** Calculate the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) to determine if the roots are real. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\). This shortcut can be used to quickly find the sum without needing to solve for each root individually.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with signs and fractions, as these are common sources of error.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
