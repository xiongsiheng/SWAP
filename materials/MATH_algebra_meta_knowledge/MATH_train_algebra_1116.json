{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying and rationalizing the denominator of this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Fraction within a Fraction:** When dealing with fractions within fractions, start by simplifying the inner fraction first. This often involves finding a common denominator for the inner terms.\n\n2. **Rationalizing Denominators:** Use the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate any square roots in the denominator. For example, if the denominator is \\(a + \\sqrt{b}\\), multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(a - \\sqrt{b}\\).\n\n3. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly when multiplying expressions. This includes ensuring that each term in the numerator is multiplied by each term in the denominator.\n\n4. **Simplifying Algebraic Expressions:** Combine like terms and simplify algebraic expressions step by step to avoid errors. Pay attention to signs and coefficients.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After simplifying, double-check your calculations for any arithmetic errors, especially in operations involving square roots and fractions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while working with complex fractions and rationalizing denominators."}
