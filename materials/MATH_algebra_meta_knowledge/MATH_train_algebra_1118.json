{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Zero Points Method:** Identify the points where the expression equals zero, which are \\( n = -3 \\) and \\( n = 7 \\). These points divide the number line into intervals.\n\n2. **Sign Analysis:** Test the sign of the expression in each interval by choosing a test point from each interval (e.g., \\( n < -3 \\), \\( -3 < n < 7 \\), \\( n > 7 \\)). Determine where the product \\((n+3)(n-7)\\) is non-positive.\n\n3. **Include Boundary Points:** Since the inequality is \\(\\le 0\\), include the points \\( n = -3 \\) and \\( n = 7 \\) in your solution set.\n\n4. **Count Integers:** After determining the interval(s) where the inequality holds, count the integers within those intervals, including the boundary points.\n\n5. **Double-Check Intervals:** Ensure that you correctly identify and count all integers in the specified range to avoid missing or double-counting integers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
