{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplification Before Substitution:** Always try to simplify the algebraic expression as much as possible before substituting the value of \\( x \\). This can often reduce the complexity of the calculation and minimize the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\n2. **Factoring Techniques:** Use factoring techniques to simplify the numerator and denominator if possible. For example, recognize that \\( x^8 + 12x^4 + 36 \\) can be factored into \\( (x^4 + 6)^2 \\), which simplifies the division.\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting \\( x = 5 \\), ensure that you substitute correctly into each part of the expression. Double-check that each \\( x \\) is correctly replaced by 5.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with powers of 5. Calculations involving large numbers can be prone to mistakes, so double-check each step.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After computing the value, consider verifying the result by substituting \\( x = 5 \\) into the simplified expression to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
