{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing the range of a function involving absolute values, consider the following:\n\n1. **Critical Points:** Identify the critical points where the expression inside the absolute value changes sign. For \\( y = |x+7| - |x-2| \\), these points are \\( x = -7 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n2. **Interval Analysis:** Break the function into different intervals based on these critical points and analyze the behavior of the function in each interval. This helps in understanding how the absolute values affect the function's output.\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify the function in each interval by removing the absolute values. For example, for \\( x < -7 \\), \\( |x+7| = -(x+7) \\) and \\( |x-2| = -(x-2) \\).\n\n4. **Graphical Insight:** Optionally, sketch a graph of the function to visually confirm the range. This can help in identifying any potential errors in the algebraic analysis.\n\n5. **Boundary Values:** Check the function's value at the critical points and at infinity (both positive and negative) to ensure the range is correctly identified.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check the range by testing values within each interval and at the boundaries to ensure consistency with the derived range.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors and ensure a more accurate computation of the function's range."}
