{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponent Rules:** Familiarize yourself with the rules of exponents, especially those involving negative exponents and reciprocals. For example, \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1}\\) is equivalent to 8.\n\n2. **Isolating Variables:** When solving for a variable in an equation involving exponents, isolate the variable term first. In this case, you need to isolate \\((x-4)^3\\).\n\n3. **Taking Cube Roots:** When you have an equation in the form \\((x-4)^3 = k\\), solve for \\(x\\) by taking the cube root of both sides. Remember that the cube root of a number gives a unique solution, unlike square roots which can have positive and negative solutions.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding a potential solution, substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to ensure that no arithmetic or algebraic errors were made during the solving process.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the operations and transformations you perform on the equation. Small mistakes in handling exponents or roots can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
