{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for \\( x \\) in an arithmetic sequence, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recall that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is known as the common difference.\n\n2. **Identifying the Common Difference:** For the given sequence \\( 1^2, x^2, 3^2, \\ldots \\), determine the common difference by subtracting the first term from the second term: \\( x^2 - 1^2 \\).\n\n3. **Using the Common Difference:** Since the sequence is arithmetic, the difference between the second and third terms should also match the common difference: \\( 3^2 - x^2 \\).\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:** Equate the two expressions for the common difference to form an equation: \\( x^2 - 1^2 = 3^2 - x^2 \\).\n\n5. **Solving the Equation:** Simplify and solve the equation for \\( x \\). Ensure that \\( x > 0 \\) as specified in the problem.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the value of \\( x \\) back into the sequence to confirm that it fits the arithmetic pattern.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving the problem."}
