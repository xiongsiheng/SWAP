{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function:** Recognize that the given function is a quadratic equation, which typically represents a parabola. Since the coefficient of \\( t^2 \\) is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find the time \\( t \\) when the temperature is exactly 77 degrees, set the quadratic function equal to 77: \\(-t^2 + 12t + 50 = 77\\).\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form \\( at^2 + bt^c + c = 0 \\). Use the quadratic formula \\( t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the values of \\( t \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Interpreting the Results:** Since you are looking for the largest \\( t \\) value, choose the positive root if both roots are real. If the roots are complex, recheck your calculations.\n\n5. **Checking the Context:** Ensure that the time \\( t \\) makes sense in the context of the problem (e.g., \\( t \\) should be non-negative and within a reasonable range for hours past noon).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
