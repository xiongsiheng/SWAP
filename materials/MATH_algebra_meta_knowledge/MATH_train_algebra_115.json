{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying algebraic expressions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Remember to distribute any negative signs or coefficients correctly across all terms inside parentheses.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms (terms with the same variable raised to the same power). For example, combine all terms involving \\(x^2\\), \\(x\\), and constant terms separately.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to addition and subtraction, especially when dealing with negative numbers or coefficients, to avoid arithmetic mistakes.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) correctly, ensuring that you handle parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After simplifying, double-check your expression to ensure that all terms are correctly combined and that the expression is in the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying algebraic expressions."}
