{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** When given a specific value for one of the variables (like \\(x = 2\\) in this case), substitute this value into both equations to eliminate one variable.\n\n2. **Solving Linear Equations:** Ensure you correctly solve the resulting linear equations. This involves careful handling of coefficients and constants, especially when dealing with variables on both sides of the equation.\n\n3. **Checking Consistency:** After finding a value for \\(a\\), verify that the solution \\((x, y)\\) satisfies both original equations to ensure there are no algebraic or arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as these can easily introduce errors.\n\n5. **System of Equations:** Understand that a system of linear equations can have a unique solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions. Ensure your solution method aligns with the type of system you are dealing with.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
