{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Equating Polynomials:** When you equate the given rational expression to the sum of two terms, ensure that the denominators match. This implies that the numerators must be equal for the equation to hold True for all \\(x\\) except where the denominator is zero.\n\n2. **Coefficient Matching:** After setting the numerators equal, match the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\(x\\) on both sides of the equation. This method helps in systematically finding the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Choosing Strategic Values for \\(x\\):** Sometimes, substituting specific values for \\(x\\) (like \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 1\\), etc.) can simplify the process of finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). However, avoid using values that make the denominator zero.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and polynomial coefficients, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), verify by substituting these values back into the original equation or by checking if the numerators match for a few different values of \\(x\\). This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
