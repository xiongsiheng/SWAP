{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function, denoted by \\(\\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil\\), returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). Ensure you correctly apply this function to the result of your calculation.\n\n2. **Simplifying Square Roots:** When dealing with square roots, simplify them to their simplest form. For example, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{49}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{49}}{\\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{7}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Negating Values:** Be careful when negating values, especially fractions. For instance, \\(-\\frac{7}{2}\\) is a negative number, which affects the application of the ceiling function.\n\n4. **Applying the Ceiling Function to Negative Numbers:** When applying the ceiling function to negative numbers, remember that \\(\\left\\lceil -x \\right\\rceil\\) is not the same as \\(-\\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil\\). Instead, it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(-x\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and negative numbers, to ensure accuracy in applying the ceiling function.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
