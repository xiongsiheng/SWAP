{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope Calculation:** Use the formula for the slope of a line between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), which is \\(a = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). Ensure you correctly identify which coordinates correspond to \\(x_1, y_1\\) and \\(x_2, y_2\\).\n\n2. **Point-Slope Form:** Once you have the slope \\(a\\), use one of the points to find \\(b\\) by substituting into the equation \\(y = ax + b\\) and solving for \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Coordinate Accuracy:** Double-check the coordinates of the points to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting values into the equation to find \\(b\\), ensure you correctly substitute and simplify the equation to avoid algebraic mistakes.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:** After finding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), calculate \\(a - b\\) carefully to ensure no errors in the final step.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
