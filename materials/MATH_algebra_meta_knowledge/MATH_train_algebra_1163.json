{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization Techniques:** Understand how to factor polynomials effectively, especially recognizing common factors and grouping terms to reveal patterns.\n\n2. **Equating Coefficients:** When two expressions are stated to be equivalent, their corresponding coefficients must be equal. This can help in setting up equations to solve for unknown variables.\n\n3. **Exponent Rules:** Be proficient with the rules of exponents, such as \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\), as these will be crucial in manipulating the given equation.\n\n4. **System of Equations:** Be prepared to set up and solve a system of equations to find the values of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\). This might involve substitution or elimination methods.\n\n5. **Checking Consistency:** After deriving values for \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\), ensure that these values make both sides of the equation identical when substituted back into the equation. This step verifies the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
