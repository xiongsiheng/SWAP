{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Always follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure correct evaluation. In this case, exponents should be calculated first, followed by multiplication.\n\n2. **Simplifying Before Multiplying:** Simplify each term as much as possible before multiplying them together. This reduces the complexity of the final multiplication step.\n\n3. **Using Known Identities:** Recognize and use mathematical identities that might simplify the expression. For example, identities related to sums of powers can sometimes be applied.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each operation, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with exponents and multiplications.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have your final answer, consider verifying it by breaking down the expression into simpler parts and checking each step independently.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
