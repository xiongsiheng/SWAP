{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying algebraic expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms, which are terms with the same variable raised to the same power. For example, combine all terms involving \\(x^2\\) together, all terms involving \\(x\\) together, and all constant terms together.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly when expanding expressions. Remember that \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure correct simplification. This means perform operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n4. **Sign Errors:** Be cautious with signs, especially when subtracting expressions. Subtracting a negative term is equivalent to adding the positive counterpart.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After simplifying, double-check your expression to ensure all like terms are combined correctly and the signs are accurate. This step helps catch any minor errors that might have been overlooked during the simplification process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying algebraic expressions."}
