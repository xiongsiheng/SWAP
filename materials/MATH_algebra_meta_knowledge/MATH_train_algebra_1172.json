{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( f(g(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( g \\) to \\( x \\), and then apply \\( f \\) to the result of \\( g(x) \\). This sequence is crucial for correct evaluation.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\), ensure that you substitute correctly. This involves replacing every \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) \\) with the expression \\( g(x) \\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions. This includes performing multiplications and divisions before additions and subtractions, and handling parentheses first.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with integers or simple fractions, as these can be prone to careless errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( f(g(5)) \\), you can verify your result by independently calculating \\( g(5) \\) and then \\( f \\) of that result to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
