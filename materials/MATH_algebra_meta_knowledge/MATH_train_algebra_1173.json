{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving ceiling functions and square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function \\(\\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil\\) returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). This means you need to find the integer immediately above the value of \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Approximating Square Roots:** Use a calculator or a known method (like the Babylonian method) to find an accurate approximation of the square root. For example, \\(\\sqrt{140}\\) is approximately 11.83.\n\n3. **Rounding Up:** Since the ceiling function requires rounding up to the nearest integer, even if the square root is very close to a whole number, you must round up. For instance, \\(\\left\\lceil 11.83 \\right\\rceil\\) is 12.\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Ensure that the value you obtain is indeed the smallest integer greater than the square root. Verify that \\(11.83\\) is less than 12 but greater than or equal to 11.\n\n5. **Consistency in Calculations:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the square root is correctly approximated and that the ceiling function is applied accurately.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in evaluating such expressions."}
