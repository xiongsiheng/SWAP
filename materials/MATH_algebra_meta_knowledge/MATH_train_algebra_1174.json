{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Square Both Sides:** When you square both sides of an equation to eliminate the square root, remember that this operation can introduce extraneous solutions. Always verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When you obtain a quadratic equation after squaring both sides, use the quadratic formula or factoring techniques to find the values of \\(x\\). Ensure that you correctly apply these methods to avoid calculation errors.\n\n3. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** After finding the values of \\(x\\), substitute them back into the original equation to confirm they are valid solutions. This step is crucial to avoid including incorrect answers in your calculations.\n\n4. **Calculating the Average:** When finding the average of the solutions, ensure you correctly add the values and divide by the number of solutions. Missteps in arithmetic can lead to an incorrect average.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and operations in your calculations, as small errors can significantly impact the final result.\n\nThese guidelines will help you minimize errors and ensure accuracy in solving problems involving square roots and quadratic equations."}
