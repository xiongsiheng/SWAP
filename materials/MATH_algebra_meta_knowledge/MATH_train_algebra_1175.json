{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving function compositions and inverses, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverses:** The inverse of a function reverses the effect of the function. For example, if \\( f(a) = b \\), then \\( f^{-1}(b) = a \\). Ensure you correctly identify and apply the inverses of given functions.\n\n2. **Commutativity:** Note that function composition is not commutative, meaning \\( f(g(x)) \\) is not necessarily the same as \\( g(f(x)) \\). Apply functions in the correct order as specified in the problem.\n\n3. **Simplification:** Simplify the expression step by step, starting from the innermost function and working outward. This helps in maintaining clarity and reducing the chance of errors.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** After computing each step, substitute the result back into the next function. Double-check each step to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with multiple compositions and inverses.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions or complex numbers, as these can introduce computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving function compositions and inverses."}
