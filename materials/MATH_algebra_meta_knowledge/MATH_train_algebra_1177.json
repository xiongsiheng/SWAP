{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Transformations:** When a function is transformed by shifting, such as \\( g(x) = f(x + a) \\), the graph of the function shifts horizontally. A positive \\( a \\) shifts the graph left, and a negative \\( a \\) shifts the graph right.\n\n2. **Identifying Inverse Functions:** A function is identical to its inverse if and only if it is symmetric about the line \\( y = x \\). This means that for every point \\( (a, b) \\) on the graph of the function, there must also be a point \\( (b, a) \\) on the graph.\n\n3. **Graphical Analysis:** Use the graph to determine the points where the function intersects with the line \\( y = x \\). The horizontal shift needed to make the function symmetric about this line will give the value of \\( a \\).\n\n4. **Verification:** After determining the value of \\( a \\), verify that the transformed function \\( g(x) \\) indeed intersects with the line \\( y = x \\) at the same points as its inverse by checking the symmetry graphically or algebraically.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
