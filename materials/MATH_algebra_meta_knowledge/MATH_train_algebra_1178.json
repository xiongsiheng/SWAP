{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( k \\) in this intersection problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitute Coordinates:** Since the lines intersect at \\( x = -8.4 \\), substitute this value into either equation to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinate of the intersection point.\n\n2. **Choose the Easier Equation:** Opt to substitute \\( x = -8.4 \\) into the equation that appears simpler or easier to solve for \\( y \\), which can reduce computational errors.\n\n3. **Calculate \\( y \\) Accurately:** Ensure that you perform the arithmetic accurately when calculating \\( y \\). Miscalculations here will directly affect the value of \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Use the Intersection Point:** Once you have the coordinates of the intersection point \\( (-8.4, y) \\), substitute these values into the other equation to solve for \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Substitution:** Verify that you have substituted the correct values into the correct equations. A common error is mixing up which variable goes into which equation.\n\n6. **Final Verification:** After finding \\( k \\), consider substituting \\( x = -8.4 \\) and the calculated \\( y \\) back into the original equations to confirm that they both yield consistent results.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving for \\( k \\)."}
