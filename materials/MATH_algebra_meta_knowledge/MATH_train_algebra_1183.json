{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Solving Inequalities:** When solving inequalities, remember to reverse the inequality sign if you multiply or divide by a negative number.\n\n2. **System of Inequalities:** Analyze each inequality separately first, then combine the results to find the solution set that satisfies both inequalities simultaneously.\n\n3. **Positive Integral Values:** Focus on finding the range of values for \\(a\\) that ensure \\(x = 2\\) is the only positive integer solution. This involves setting up conditions based on the inequalities given.\n\n4. **Boundary Conditions:** Pay attention to the boundary conditions where the inequalities change their solution sets, as these can affect the number of valid solutions.\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining the range of \\(a\\), verify that each value within this range indeed makes \\(x = 2\\) the only positive integer solution by substituting back into the inequalities.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
