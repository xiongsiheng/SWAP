{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Look for any common factors in the terms of the expression. In this case, \\((x-3)\\) is a common factor.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly to factor out the common factor. Remember that \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\).\n\n3. **Simplify Each Term:** After factoring out the common factor, simplify each term to ensure they are in the simplest form.\n\n4. **Check Your Work:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to verify that you get the original expression. This step helps confirm the correctness of your factorization.\n\n5. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be careful with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with signs and coefficients, to avoid common mistakes.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate factoring of the expression."}
