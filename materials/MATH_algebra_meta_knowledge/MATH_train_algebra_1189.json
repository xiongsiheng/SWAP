{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Transformations:** Recognize how transformations affect the graph of a function. For example, \\( y = h(2x) \\) compresses the graph of \\( y = h(x) \\) horizontally by a factor of 2, while \\( y = 2j(x) \\) stretches the graph of \\( y = j(x) \\) vertically by a factor of 2.\n\n2. **Intersection Points:** When finding intersection points of transformed functions, consider how the transformations affect the original coordinates. For instance, if \\( (a, b) \\) is a point on \\( y = h(x) \\), then \\( (a/2, b) \\) will be a point on \\( y = h(2x) \\).\n\n3. **Coordinate Sum:** When asked for the sum of the coordinates of an intersection point, ensure you correctly identify the coordinates and add them accurately.\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by ensuring that the identified intersection point satisfies both transformed functions.\n\n5. **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualize or sketch the transformations to better understand how the points of intersection might shift due to the transformations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
