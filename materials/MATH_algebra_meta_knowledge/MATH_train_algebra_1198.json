{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** Remember that the inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) essentially reverses the operations of \\(f(x)\\). If \\(f(a) = b\\), then \\(f^{-1}(b) = a\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find \\(x\\) such that \\(f^{-1}(x) = 4\\), you need to determine \\(x\\) such that \\(f(4) = x\\). This involves substituting 4 into the original function.\n\n3. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you substitute the value correctly into the function. Misplacing or miscalculating the substitution can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved, especially when dealing with exponents and coefficients. Small errors in calculation can significantly affect the outcome.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the value of \\(x\\), it is good practice to verify by checking if \\(f(x) = 4\\) to ensure the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
