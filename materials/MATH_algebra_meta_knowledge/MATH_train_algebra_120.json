{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving arithmetic sequences, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequence:** An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is called the common difference (d).\n\n2. **Formula for nth Term:** The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula \\( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\), where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term and \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\n3. **Sum of First n Terms:** The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d) \\).\n\n4. **Using Given Information:** Use the given information about the sum of terms and specific terms to set up equations. For example, if the sum of the first four terms is given, you can use the sum formula to find the first term and common difference.\n\n5. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** You may need to solve simultaneous equations to find the values of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( d \\). Ensure you handle the algebra correctly to avoid calculation errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you find the common difference and the first term, calculate the sixth term using the nth term formula and verify it aligns with the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems related to arithmetic sequences."}
