{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** Ensure you correctly interpret the given ratio. In this case, the ratio of \\( b \\) to \\( a \\) being 3 means \\( b = 3a \\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Elimination:** When substituting one equation into another, make sure you substitute correctly. For instance, substituting \\( b = 3a \\) into \\( b = 12 - 5a \\) should be done accurately to avoid algebraic mistakes.\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Be meticulous when solving linear equations. Combine like terms correctly and isolate the variable \\( a \\) accurately.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the value of \\( a \\), substitute it back into both the original equations to verify that it satisfies both conditions. This step helps catch any errors in the solving process.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients, as errors often occur in these areas. For example, ensure you correctly handle the coefficient of \\( -5a \\) in the equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
