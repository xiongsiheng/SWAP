{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex fractions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Multiplying by the Conjugate:** To eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(2 - 3i\\) is \\(2 + 3i\\).\n\n2. **Distributing Correctly:** Ensure that you distribute correctly when multiplying the numerator by the conjugate of the denominator. This includes handling both the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After multiplication, combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. This will help in simplifying the expression to the form \\(a + bi\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying Fractions:** If necessary, simplify the resulting fractions to their simplest form, ensuring that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are written as improper fractions if needed.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative signs and complex numbers, as these can lead to common errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying complex fractions."}
