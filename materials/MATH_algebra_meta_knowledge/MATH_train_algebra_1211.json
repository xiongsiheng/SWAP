{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( a \\) in the equation \\( g(a) = 0 \\) for a linear function like \\( g(x) = 3x - 4 \\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Linear Functions:** Recognize that a linear function of the form \\( g(x) = mx + b \\) represents a straight line on a graph, where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Setting the Function to Zero:** To find the value of \\( a \\) such that \\( g(a) = 0 \\), set the function equal to zero: \\( 3a - 4 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Solve the resulting linear equation by isolating \\( a \\). In this case, add 4 to both sides and then divide by 3.\n\n4. **Checking Your Solution:** Substitute the value of \\( a \\) back into the original function to verify that \\( g(a) = 0 \\). This step ensures that there are no arithmetic errors in your solution.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to avoid simple mistakes that can lead to incorrect answers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( a \\) in linear function problems."}
