{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the polynomial \\( h(x) \\) in this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Given Polynomials:** Clearly identify the polynomial on the left-hand side (LHS) and the polynomial on the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract Polynomials:** To find \\( h(x) \\), you need to subtract the polynomial on the LHS from the polynomial on the RHS. Ensure you subtract each term individually, matching terms of the same degree.\n\n3. **Order of Terms:** Arrange the terms of \\( h(x) \\) in decreasing order of degree, as specified in the problem. This helps in clearly presenting the polynomial and avoiding confusion.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to the signs and coefficients when subtracting polynomials. Incorrect handling of signs can lead to mistakes in the final polynomial.\n\n5. **Double-Check Your Work:** After finding \\( h(x) \\), double-check your subtraction by adding \\( h(x) \\) back to the LHS polynomial to ensure it equals the RHS polynomial. This step helps verify the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points will help you minimize errors and ensure accuracy in solving polynomial subtraction problems."}
