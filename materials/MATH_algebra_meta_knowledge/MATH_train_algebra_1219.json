{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Definitions:** Ensure you correctly interpret the function definition. In this case, \\( F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d \\) means you need to compute \\( a^b \\) and \\( c \times d \\) separately and then sum them.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): first handle exponents, then multiplication, and finally addition.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Substitute the given values into the function to form an equation. Here, substitute \\( a = 2 \\), \\( c = 4 \\), and \\( d = 11 \\) into \\( F(a, b, c, d) \\) to get \\( 2^x + 4 \times 11 = 300 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for the Variable:** Isolate the variable \\( x \\) by performing algebraic operations. Start by simplifying the equation, then solve for \\( x \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially exponentiation and multiplication, as these are common sources of error.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the calculated value of \\( x \\) back into the function to verify that it satisfies the original equation. This step ensures the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
