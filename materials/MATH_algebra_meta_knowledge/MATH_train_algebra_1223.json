{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For \\( p(q(x)) \\), first evaluate \\( q(x) \\) and then use the result as the input for \\( p(x) \\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Evaluation:** When substituting values into functions, ensure you substitute correctly and evaluate step by step to avoid miscalculations.\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Be proficient in solving linear equations. Isolate the variable \\( b \\) by performing the necessary algebraic operations.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with multiple steps and operations.\n\n5. **Consistency in Notation:** Use consistent notation and be clear about what each symbol represents to avoid confusion during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
