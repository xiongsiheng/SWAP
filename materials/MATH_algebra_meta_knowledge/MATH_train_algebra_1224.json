{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** Understand that the ratio of the areas of two squares is the square of the ratio of their side lengths. If the ratio of the areas is \\(\frac{32}{63}\\), then the ratio of the side lengths is \\(\\sqrt{\frac{32}{63}}\\).\n\n2. **Rationalizing the Denominator:** When rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving square roots, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. This process eliminates the square root in the denominator.\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** Ensure that you simplify expressions correctly, especially when dealing with square roots. Combine like terms and simplify fractions to their lowest terms.\n\n4. **Identifying Integer Parts:** Identify the integer parts \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly from the simplified form \\(\frac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}\\). Ensure that \\(b\\) is the number under the square root and \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are the coefficients outside and in the denominator, respectively.\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:** After identifying \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), calculate the sum \\(a + b + c\\) accurately. Double-check your arithmetic to avoid simple mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
