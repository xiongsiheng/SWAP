{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Formula:** Recognize that \\((x - y)(x + y)\\) is a form of the difference of squares, which simplifies to \\(x^2 - y^2\\). This identity can simplify calculations.\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) correctly into the formula. Misplacing values can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved, especially when squaring numbers. Simple arithmetic errors can significantly affect the outcome.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the calculations, double-check your work to ensure that all steps were executed correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
