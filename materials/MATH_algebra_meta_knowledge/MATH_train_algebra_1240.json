{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Forms:** Recognize that expressions like \\(2^n\\), \\(4^n\\), and \\(64^{n-36}\\) can be rewritten using the same base. For example, \\(4^n\\) is equivalent to \\((2^2)^n = 2^{2n}\\), and \\(64\\) can be written as \\(2^6\\).\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When two expressions with the same base are equal, their exponents must be equal. This principle is crucial for setting up equations involving exponents.\n\n3. **Simplifying Exponents:** Combine and simplify exponents carefully. For instance, \\(2^n \\cdot 2^{2n}\\) simplifies to \\(2^{3n}\\).\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify your solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Be cautious with operations involving exponents, such as multiplication and division, as these are areas where mistakes frequently occur.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
