{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving powers of the imaginary unit \\(i\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cycle of Powers:** The powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four terms: \\(i^1 = i\\), \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), \\(i^4 = 1\\), and then the cycle repeats. This pattern can be used to simplify any power of \\(i\\) by reducing the exponent modulo 4.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation:** To find \\(i^n\\) for any integer \\(n\\), compute \\(n \\mod 4\\) and use the result to determine the value from the cycle.\n\n3. **Sum of Powers:** When summing multiple powers of \\(i\\), simplify each term individually using the cycle, then combine the results. This approach ensures each term is correctly simplified before addition.\n\n4. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious not to confuse the powers of \\(i\\) with other numbers or to overlook the cyclical nature of the powers. Double-check each simplification step to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After summing the simplified terms, verify the result by comparing it to known sums of powers of \\(i\\) or by re-evaluating the expression if necessary.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
