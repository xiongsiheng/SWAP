{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:** Recognize that the number of logs in each row follows an arithmetic sequence, decreasing by one log per row. This pattern is crucial for setting up the correct calculation.\n\n2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Series:** The total number of logs can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and \\( a_n \\) is the last term.\n\n3. **Counting Rows:** Ensure you correctly count the number of rows in the stack. In this case, starting from 12 logs and ending at 3 logs, there are 10 rows.\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious not to simply subtract the number of logs in the top row from the bottom row and multiply by the number of rows, as this does not account for the decreasing pattern correctly.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the total number of logs, consider manually adding the logs row by row to verify your answer, which helps catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
