{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the range of a function like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Functions:** Recognize that for a function \\( f(x) = x^k \\) where \\( k < 0 \\), the function represents a decreasing exponential. This is because a negative exponent means the function involves a reciprocal, which decreases as \\( x \\) increases.\n\n2. **Behavior at Boundaries:** Analyze the behavior of the function at the boundaries of the interval. For \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) = 1^k = 1 \\). As \\( x \\) approaches infinity, \\( x^k \\) approaches 0.\n\n3. **Range Determination:** Since the function is continuous and decreasing on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\), the range will be all values between \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(\\infty) \\). This means the range is \\((0, 1]\\).\n\n4. **Graphical Insight:** Optionally, sketching a graph of the function can help visualize the range and confirm the analytical approach.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the reasoning by ensuring that no values outside the determined range can be produced by the function within the given interval.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while determining the range of such functions."}
