{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Intercepts:** Recall that the x-intercept occurs when \\( y = 0 \\) and the y-intercept occurs when \\( x = 0 \\). Substitute these values into the equation to find the intercepts.\n\n2. **Formulating Intercepts:** For the given line \\( 4x + 7y + c = 0 \\), the x-intercept (where \\( y = 0 \\)) is \\( -\frac{c}{4} \\) and the y-intercept (where \\( x = 0 \\)) is \\( -\frac{c}{7} \\).\n\n3. **Sum of Intercepts:** Given that the sum of the intercepts is 22, set up the equation \\( -\frac{c}{4} + -\frac{c}{7} = 22 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( c \\):** Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator (28 in this case) and solve the resulting equation for \\( c \\).\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic operations, especially when combining fractions and solving for \\( c \\), to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
