{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Nested Radicals:** When dealing with nested radicals, simplify from the innermost part outward. Ensure that you correctly handle the nested structure and simplify each part step by step.\n\n2. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Recognize and apply algebraic identities where applicable. For example, expressions involving the sum and difference of square roots can sometimes be simplified using identities like \\((\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b})^2 = a + b + 2\\sqrt{ab}\\).\n\n3. **Checking for Rational Sums:** If the problem involves the sum of two square roots, consider whether the sum can be rational. This often involves recognizing patterns or specific forms that simplify to a rational number.\n\n4. **Precision in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail in your calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and arithmetic operations. Small errors can significantly impact the final result.\n\n5. **Verification of Results:** After obtaining a result, verify it by substituting back into the original expression or by checking if the result satisfies any known properties or identities related to the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
