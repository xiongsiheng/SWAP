{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formula for the nth Term:** The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n2. **Identify the First Term and Common Difference:** Ensure you correctly identify the first term \\(a_1\\) and the common difference \\(d\\) of the sequence. For example, in the sequence 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, the first term \\(a_1\\) is 1 and the common difference \\(d\\) is 3.\n\n3. **Substitute Correctly:** When substituting values into the formula, make sure you use the correct values for \\(a_1\\), \\(d\\), and \\(n\\). Double-check your substitutions to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying and adding, to ensure accuracy in your calculations.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by manually checking the sequence up to the term you calculated, although this might not be practical for large values of \\(n\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
