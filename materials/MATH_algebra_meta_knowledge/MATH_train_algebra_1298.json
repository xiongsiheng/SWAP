{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Geometric Sequence:** Recognize that the height of each bounce forms a geometric sequence where each term is half the previous term. The general form of a geometric sequence is \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Common Ratio:** In this problem, the common ratio \\(r\\) is 0.5, as each bounce reaches half the height of the previous bounce.\n\n3. **Inequality Setup:** To find when the height is less than 1 foot, set up an inequality \\(a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)} < 1\\) and solve for \\(n\\).\n\n4. **Logarithmic Solution:** Solving for \\(n\\) may involve using logarithms, as \\(n\\) can be found by rearranging the inequality to isolate \\(n\\) on one side.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and logarithms, as small errors can significantly impact the result.\n\n6. **Verification:** After calculating \\(n\\), verify by substituting \\(n\\) back into the sequence formula to confirm the height is indeed less than 1 foot.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
