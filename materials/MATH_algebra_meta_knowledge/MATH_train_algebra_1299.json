{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Equivalent Fractions:** Remember that two fractions are equivalent if they represent the same value. This means that the cross products (numerator of one fraction times the denominator of the other) must be equal.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** When you need to find a number to add to both the numerator and the denominator to make the fractions equivalent, set up an equation where the new numerator and denominator are expressed in terms of the original fraction and the unknown number.\n\n3. **Solving for the Unknown:** Isolate the unknown number by performing algebraic operations. This often involves clearing fractions by multiplying through by the least common denominator.\n\n4. **Checking Your Answer:** After finding the number, substitute it back into the fraction to ensure that the new fraction is indeed equivalent to the target fraction. This step verifies the correctness of your solution.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and operations in your algebraic manipulations to avoid common mistakes such as miscalculations or incorrect sign usage.\n\nThese guidelines will help you approach the problem systematically and reduce the likelihood of errors."}
