{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognizing Series Patterns:** Identify if the series is a geometric series. In this case, the series is geometric with the first term \\(a = \frac{1}{3}\\) and common ratio \\(r = \frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Sum of a Geometric Series:** Use the formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of a geometric series: \\(S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** When dealing with fractions, ensure that you simplify them correctly, especially when multiplying or dividing fractions.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to the powers of the common ratio \\(r\\) and ensure that calculations involving these powers are accurate.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the sum, verify the result by checking if the sum of the fractions matches the given series. This step helps in catching any computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
