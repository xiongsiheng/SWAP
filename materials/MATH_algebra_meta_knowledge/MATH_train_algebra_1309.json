{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand the concept of function composition, where you apply one function to the result of another. In this case, you need to find \\( g(-3) \\) first and then use that result as the input for \\( f \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations when evaluating functions. Start by evaluating the inner function \\( g(x) \\) and then use the result to evaluate the outer function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the correct values into the functions. For example, when calculating \\( g(-3) \\), substitute \\(-3\\) directly into the expression \\( 3x + 4 \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and multiplications. Errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating \\( f(g(-3)) \\), you can quickly verify the result by ensuring that the steps taken are logical and the arithmetic is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
