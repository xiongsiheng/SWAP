{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying expressions involving absolute values and exponents, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Always follow the correct order of operations: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this case, exponents are calculated before addition and subtraction.\n\n2. **Exponentiation of Negative Numbers:** When a negative number is raised to a power, the negative sign is applied after the number is squared. For example, \\(-3^2\\) results in \\(-9\\), not \\(9\\), because the exponent applies only to the 3, not the negative sign.\n\n3. **Absolute Value:** The absolute value of a number is always non-negative. It represents the distance of the number from zero on the number line, regardless of direction.\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Break down the expression into manageable parts, simplifying each part separately before combining them. This helps in avoiding errors in complex expressions.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After simplifying, double-check each step to ensure accuracy, especially in operations involving exponents and absolute values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
