{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Recognize that you can factor out the common term (1212 in this case) using the distributive property: \\(a \times b - c \times b = (a - c) \times b\\). This simplifies the calculation.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that you perform subtraction and multiplication accurately. Subtraction errors are common, so double-check the difference between the coefficients (55 and 15).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Although the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) is straightforward here, always ensure you perform multiplication before subtraction as per the standard rules.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After applying the distributive property, simplify the expression by performing the remaining multiplication and subtraction.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have your final answer, it can be helpful to quickly estimate the result using simpler numbers to ensure your answer is reasonable.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while computing such expressions."}
