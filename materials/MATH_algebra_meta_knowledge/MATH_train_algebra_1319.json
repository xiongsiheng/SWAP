{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the largest prime factor of a number, consider the following:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Process:** Start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number (2) and continue dividing by the next smallest prime numbers (3, 5, 7, etc.) until you reach a prime number.\n\n2. **Checking Divisibility:** Use divisibility rules to quickly determine if a number is divisible by smaller primes (e.g., a number is divisible by 2 if it is even, by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, etc.).\n\n3. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious not to skip any prime numbers in your factorization process, as missing a prime factor can lead to an incorrect result.\n\n4. **Verification:** Once you have a list of prime factors, multiply them together to ensure they indeed equal the original number, which helps verify the correctness of your factorization.\n\n5. **Largest Factor Identification:** After completing the factorization, identify the largest prime factor from your list. This is typically the last prime number you used in the factorization process.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in finding the largest prime factor of a given number."}
