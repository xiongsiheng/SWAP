{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Forms:** Recognize that both 81 and 27 can be expressed as powers of 3. Specifically, \\(81 = 3^4\\) and \\(27 = 3^3\\). This conversion simplifies the equation.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When two expressions with the same base are equal, their exponents must be equal. This principle is crucial for setting up the equation in terms of \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** The resulting equation will be linear in \\(x\\). Ensure you correctly isolate \\(x\\) by performing algebraic operations accurately.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially exponentiations and multiplications, as these are common areas for errors.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** After finding \\(x\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that both sides are indeed equal. This step confirms the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
