{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to find the length of the side of the square. The distance formula between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Square of the Side:** Once you have the length of the side, square it to find the area of the square. The area \\(A\\) of a square with side length \\(s\\) is \\(A = s^2\\).\n\n3. **Coordinate Precision:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the coordinates into the distance formula and perform the arithmetic accurately to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After calculating the side length and the area, double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Understanding of Adjacency:** Ensure that the points given are indeed adjacent points on the square, as this implies they form one side of the square. If points were diagonally opposite, the approach would differ.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
