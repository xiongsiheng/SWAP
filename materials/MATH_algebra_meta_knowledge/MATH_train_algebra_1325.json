{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Zero Points:** Identify the points where the expression equals zero, as these points (in this case, \\(n = 2\\) and \\(n = -4\\)) will divide the number line into intervals.\n\n2. **Testing Intervals:** Test the sign of the expression in each interval formed by the zero points. This involves choosing a test value from each interval and determining whether the expression is positive or negative.\n\n3. **Graphical Representation:** Optionally, visualize the inequality on a number line to help understand where the expression is negative.\n\n4. **Combining Results:** Combine the results from testing each interval to determine the overall solution set.\n\n5. **Boundary Points:** Be cautious about including or excluding the boundary points (2 and -4) based on the inequality type (< or \u2264).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such inequalities."}
