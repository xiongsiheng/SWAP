{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the maximum value of a quadratic expression like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Quadratic Nature:** Recognize that the expression $-5r^2 + 40r - 12$ is a quadratic function, which is a parabola. Since the coefficient of $r^2$ (which is -5) is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum value.\n\n2. **Vertex Formula:** Use the vertex formula to find the maximum value. For a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, the vertex (which gives the maximum or minimum value) occurs at $r = -b/(2a)$. Here, $a = -5$ and $b = 40$, so $r = -40/(2*-5) = 4$.\n\n3. **Substitute Back:** Substitute the value of $r$ found in the previous step back into the original equation to find the maximum value. Substituting $r = 4$ into $-5r^2 + 40r - 12$ gives the maximum value.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when substituting values back into the equation, to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification (Optional):** Optionally, you can sketch the graph of the quadratic function to visually confirm the maximum point.\n\nThese steps help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when determining the maximum value of a quadratic expression."}
