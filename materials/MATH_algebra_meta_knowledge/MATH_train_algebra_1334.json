{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Formulas:** Ensure you correctly recall and apply the formulas for the area and perimeter of a rectangle. The area is given by \\( \text{length} \times \text{width} \\) and the perimeter by \\( 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** When setting up the equation where the area equals the perimeter, be precise in substituting the given dimensions into the formulas.\n\n3. **Solving Algebraically:** When solving the resulting algebraic equation, be careful with the distribution of terms and the simplification of expressions. Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving for \\( x \\), verify that the solution(s) make sense in the context of the problem (e.g., dimensions should be positive). Substitute the value(s) back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy both the area and perimeter equality.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to detail, especially in operations involving both addition and multiplication, as these can be prone to errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
