{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the given information into a system of linear equations. For example, if 'b' represents the cost of a burger and 's' represents the cost of a soda, you can set up equations based on the purchases: Uri's purchase can be represented as \\(2b + s = 2.10\\) and Gen's purchase as \\(b + 2s = 2.40\\).\n\n2. **Converting Units:** Ensure that all monetary amounts are in the same unit. Since the question asks for the cost in cents, convert dollars to cents (e.g., $2.10 becomes 210 cents).\n\n3. **Solving the System of Equations:** Use algebraic methods such as substitution or elimination to solve for the variables. Be meticulous with your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of 'b' and 's', substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the details of the problem, such as the number of items purchased and their respective costs, to correctly set up and solve the equations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
