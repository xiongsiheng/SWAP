{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the value of \\( x \\) that maximizes a quadratic function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** For a quadratic function in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex (which gives the maximum or minimum value) can be found using the formula \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\). In this case, identify \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) correctly from the quadratic expression.\n\n2. **Sign of \\( a \\):** Determine whether the quadratic opens upwards or downwards by the sign of \\( a \\). If \\( a \\) is negative, as in \\( -x^2 - 6x + 12 \\), the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex represents a maximum point.\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculation:** Ensure precise calculations when applying the vertex formula, as errors in calculating \\( x \\) will directly affect the correctness of the solution.\n\n4. **Substitution Check:** Optionally, you can substitute the calculated \\( x \\) back into the original quadratic function to verify that it indeed gives the maximum value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the maximum value in quadratic functions."}
