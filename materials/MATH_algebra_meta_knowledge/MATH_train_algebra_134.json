{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to evaluate composite functions. Start by evaluating the innermost function and work outward.\n\n2. **Simplification:** Simplify each step of the function evaluation. For example, if \\( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \\), first find \\( f(-1) \\), then use that result to find \\( f(f(-1)) \\), and so on.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for patterns in the function evaluations. Repeated applications of the same function might lead to a recognizable pattern or cycle.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when squaring numbers and subtracting.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify intermediate steps to ensure correctness before proceeding to the next level of composition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
