{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that the sequence involves adding consecutive powers of 3. The nth term in the sequence is the sum of the first n powers of 3.\n\n2. **Sum of Powers of a Number:** The sum of the first n powers of a number can be expressed using a formula. For powers of 3, the sum of the first n terms is given by \\(3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\ldots + 3^n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Calculating Powers:** When calculating powers of 3, ensure you use the correct exponent and base. For example, \\(3^4 = 81\\).\n\n4. **Simplification:** After calculating the sum, simplify the expression using the formula provided. This involves subtracting 1 from the next power of 3 and then dividing by 2.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and division, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
