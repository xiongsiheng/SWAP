{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Variation:** Inverse variation means that as one quantity increases, the other decreases proportionally. If two quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) vary inversely, their product is a constant \\( k \\), i.e., \\( xy = k \\).\n\n2. **Using Given Information:** Utilize the given values to find the constant \\( k \\). In this case, use \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 81 \\) to determine \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the relationship \\( ab = k \\) to set up equations for different values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). For example, if \\( a \\) changes, how does \\( b \\) need to change to maintain the product \\( k \\)?\n\n4. **Solving for Unknowns:** When you have an equation with one unknown, solve it step by step. Ensure you isolate the variable correctly and perform algebraic operations accurately.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** After solving for the unknown, verify your calculations by substituting the found value back into the equation to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
