{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the maximum height of a parabolic path given by a quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Quadratic Equations:** Recognize that the given expression $-16t^2 + 80t + 21$ is a quadratic equation of the form $at^2 + bt + c$, where $a = -16$, $b = 80$, and $c = 21$.\n\n2. **Vertex of a Parabola:** The maximum height of a ball thrown in a parabolic path corresponds to the vertex of the parabola. For a quadratic equation $at^2 + bt + c$, the vertex occurs at $t = -b/(2a)$.\n\n3. **Calculating the Vertex:** Use the formula $t = -b/(2a)$ to find the time at which the maximum height occurs. Substitute this value of $t$ back into the original equation to find the maximum height.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dividing $-b$ by $2a$, as errors here can significantly affect the result.\n\n5. **Substitution and Evaluation:** After finding the time $t$ at the vertex, substitute this value back into the height equation to calculate the maximum height. Double-check your substitution and arithmetic to avoid errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the maximum height in parabolic motion problems."}
