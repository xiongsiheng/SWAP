{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the algae doubles in coverage every day, which is an example of exponential growth. This means the coverage on any given day is twice the coverage of the previous day.\n\n2. **Working Backwards:** Since the pond is completely covered on day 30, work backwards from this point. On day 29, the pond would have been half covered, on day 28, a quarter covered, and so on.\n\n3. **Percentage Calculation:** To find when the pond was 75% algae-free, you need to determine when it was 25% covered with algae. This is because 75% algae-free is equivalent to 25% covered.\n\n4. **Logical Reasoning:** Use logical reasoning to deduce that if the pond is completely covered on day 30, then on day 29 it was 50% covered, and on day 28 it was 25% covered.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure that the day you determine aligns with the exponential growth pattern described in the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
