{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving custom operations like $\\star$, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation Definition:** Clearly understand and apply the definition of the operation exactly as given. In this case, $a \\star b = a + \\frac{a}{b}$.\n\n2. **Substitute Values Correctly:** When substituting values into the operation, ensure that you substitute both $a$ and $b$ correctly into the formula.\n\n3. **Perform Fraction Operations Carefully:** When dealing with fractions, especially in operations, ensure that you simplify and calculate the fractions accurately. For instance, $\frac{a}{b}$ should be calculated precisely.\n\n4. **Check Arithmetic:** Double-check all arithmetic operations, including addition and division, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the result, it can be helpful to re-evaluate the operation with the calculated result to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving problems involving custom operations."}
