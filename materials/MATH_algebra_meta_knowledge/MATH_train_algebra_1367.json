{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages and Fractions:** Ensure you correctly interpret and convert percentages and fractions into their decimal equivalents. For example, 25% is equivalent to 0.25, and \\(\frac{2}{3}\\) is approximately 0.67.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** When dealing with parts of a whole, set up an equation where the sum of the parts equals the total. In this case, the sum of the seats in First Class, Business Class, and Economy Class should equal the total number of seats.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with percentages and fractions, as these can be prone to arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure that all parts of your equation are in consistent units (e.g., all in terms of number of seats).\n\n5. **Solving for the Total:** Isolate the variable representing the total number of seats and solve the equation carefully to avoid mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
