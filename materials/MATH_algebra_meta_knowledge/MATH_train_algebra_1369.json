{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance between the center of a circle and a given point, consider the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Circle Equation:** Convert the given circle equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2x + 4y - 1\\) to the standard form \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\) by completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms.\n\n2. **Identify the Center:** From the standard form, identify the coordinates \\((h, k)\\) of the center of the circle.\n\n3. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\) to calculate the distance between the center \\((h, k)\\) and the given point \\((13, 7)\\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when squaring numbers and taking square roots, to avoid numerical errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check:** Verify your calculations by re-checking the conversion to standard form and the application of the distance formula.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving this type of problem."}
