{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Work Rates:** Recognize that the work rate of a group of painters is proportional to the number of painters. If the rate is given in work-days per painter, the total work required for the job can be calculated by multiplying the number of painters by their individual work rate.\n\n2. **Proportionality:** Understand that if the number of painters changes, the total time required to complete the same amount of work will change inversely. This means that if the number of painters decreases, the time required increases proportionally.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Work:** Calculate the total work required by multiplying the number of painters by their work rate. This gives you the total work in work-days.\n\n4. **Adjusting for Fewer Painters:** When fewer painters are working, divide the total work by the new number of painters to find the new total time required.\n\n5. **Mixed Numbers:** When expressing your answer as a mixed number, ensure that you correctly convert an improper fraction into a mixed number, which involves dividing the numerator by the denominator to get a whole number and a proper fraction.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and mixed numbers, to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
