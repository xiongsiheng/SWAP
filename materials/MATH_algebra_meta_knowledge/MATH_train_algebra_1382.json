{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Undefined Expressions:** An expression is undefined when the denominator is zero. Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for the variable.\n\n2. **Factoring Polynomials:** When solving for the roots of a quadratic equation (like setting the denominator to zero), factor the polynomial if possible. This simplifies finding the roots.\n\n3. **Checking for Common Factors:** Ensure that the numerator and denominator have no common factors that could simplify the expression before concluding where it is undefined.\n\n4. **Calculating the Product:** Once you find the values of \\( x \\) that make the expression undefined, calculate their product carefully. Ensure you multiply correctly and consider any signs that might affect the result.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your factorization and arithmetic calculations to avoid common mistakes in polynomial manipulation and multiplication.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
