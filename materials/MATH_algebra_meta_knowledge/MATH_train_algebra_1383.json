{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages:** Ensure you correctly interpret the percentage decrease. If Jenny eats 20% of the jellybeans each day, she leaves 80% of the jellybeans.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the information given to set up an equation that models the situation. For instance, if \\( x \\) is the original number of jellybeans, after one day \\( 0.8x \\) remain, and after two days \\( 0.8 \times 0.8x = 0.64x \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Original Quantity:** Equate the expression for the number of jellybeans remaining after two days to the given number (32 in this case) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and percentages, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the original number of jellybeans, verify by calculating how many should remain after two days and compare with the given number to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
