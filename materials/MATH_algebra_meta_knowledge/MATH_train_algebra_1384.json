{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Composition:** When dealing with the composition of functions \\( s(r(x)) \\), first identify the values of \\( r(x) \\) that are within the domain of \\( s(x) \\). This involves checking which elements of the range of \\( r(x) \\) are also in the domain of \\( s(x) \\).\n\n2. **Domain and Range Intersection:** Determine the intersection of the range of \\( r(x) \\) and the domain of \\( s(x) \\). Only values from this intersection can be valid inputs for \\( s(x) \\).\n\n3. **Evaluating the Composition:** For each valid \\( r(x) \\) value, compute \\( s(r(x)) \\) by substituting \\( r(x) \\) into the definition of \\( s(x) \\).\n\n4. **Summing Values:** After calculating all possible values of \\( s(r(x)) \\), sum these values to get the final answer. Ensure that you include all relevant values and avoid double-counting.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and ensure that you have considered all possible combinations of \\( r(x) \\) and \\( s(x) \\). This step will help catch any oversights or miscalculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
