{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentage Problems:** Recognize that the phrase 'x is y% of z' translates to the equation \\(x = \\frac{y}{100} \\times z\\). In this case, '16 is 64% of what number' translates to \\(16 = \\frac{64}{100} \\times z\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Ensure that you correctly set up the equation based on the given information. For this problem, the equation should be \\(16 = 0.64 \\times z\\).\n\n3. **Solving for the Unknown:** Isolate the variable (z in this case) by dividing both sides of the equation by the percentage. This step is crucial to finding the correct value of z.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Perform division accurately to avoid errors. For this problem, dividing 16 by 0.64 requires careful calculation.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you have your answer, it's a good practice to verify it by substituting the value back into the original percentage statement to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving percentage-based problems."}
