{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions like $x^2y^3z$, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values for $x$, $y$, and $z$ accurately into the expression. Double-check that you have not mixed up the variables.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which includes exponents before multiplication. Calculate the exponents first, then multiply the results.\n\n3. **Fraction Multiplication:** When multiplying fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together separately. Simplify the fraction if possible.\n\n4. **Negative Numbers:** Be cautious with negative numbers, especially when raising them to powers or multiplying them. A negative number raised to an odd power remains negative, while it becomes positive when raised to an even power.\n\n5. **Final Simplification:** After performing all multiplications, simplify the expression to its simplest form. Check for any common factors that can be canceled out or simplified further.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate evaluation of the expression."}
