{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Circle Equations:** Recognize that the given equations are in the standard form of a circle, \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. Completing the square for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms can help rewrite the equations in this form.\n\n2. **Intersection of Circles:** To find the points of intersection of two circles, solve the system of equations formed by the circles. Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate the \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) terms, resulting in a linear equation that can be used to express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) or vice versa.\n\n3. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use the linear equation obtained from the subtraction to substitute into one of the original circle equations. This will result in a quadratic equation in one variable, which can be solved to find the coordinates of the intersection points.\n\n4. **Quadratic Formula:** When solving the resulting quadratic equation, use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots. Ensure accurate calculation of the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) and the roots.\n\n5. **Product of Coordinates:** To find the product of all coordinates of the intersection points, multiply the \\(x\\)-coordinates and the \\(y\\)-coordinates separately. If the intersection points are \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), the product is \\(x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot y_1 \\cdot y_2\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** After calculating the product, verify the calculations by ensuring that the intersection points satisfy both original circle equations. This step helps catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
