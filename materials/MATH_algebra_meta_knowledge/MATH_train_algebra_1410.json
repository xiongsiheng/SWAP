{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages:** Ensure you correctly interpret percentages. For example, 300% of a number is equivalent to multiplying that number by 3.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into a mathematical equation accurately. In this case, if Mickey's age is 4 years less than 300% of Jerry's age, you can represent this as \\( M = 3J - 4 \\), where \\( M \\) is Mickey's age and \\( J \\) is Jerry's age.\n\n3. **Substitution and Solving:** Substitute the given value (Mickey's age) into the equation and solve for the unknown (Jerry's age) carefully to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After solving, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with percentages and differences.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by substituting Jerry's age back into the original conditions to ensure it satisfies the problem's requirements.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
