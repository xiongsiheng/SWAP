{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the operation defined. In this case, \\( a * b = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \\). Recognize that this operation involves adding the reciprocals of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Using Given Information:** Utilize the given equations \\( a + b = 9 \\) and \\( a \times b = 20 \\) to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). This typically involves solving a system of equations.\n\n3. **Finding Reciprocals:** Once you have the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), accurately compute their reciprocals. Ensure that you correctly invert the values.\n\n4. **Adding Fractions:** When adding the reciprocals, ensure you find a common denominator. This step is crucial for obtaining the correct fraction.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify all arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and solving for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Small errors in calculations can lead to incorrect results.\n\n6. **Substitute and Verify:** Optionally, substitute the found values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy the given equations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
