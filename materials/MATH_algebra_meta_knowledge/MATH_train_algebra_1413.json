{"Knowledge": "To determine which point is farthest from the origin, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\) to calculate the distance of each point from the origin \\((0,0)\\). This simplifies to \\(d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\n2. **Squaring Coordinates:** When calculating the distance, square the x and y coordinates of each point and sum them. This step eliminates the need to compute the square root for each point initially, as comparing the squares of distances will yield the same result.\n\n3. **Comparing Values:** After computing the squared distances, compare these values to determine which is the largest. The point with the largest squared distance is the farthest from the origin.\n\n4. **Avoiding Square Roots:** Since the square root function is monotonically increasing, the point with the largest squared distance will also have the largest actual distance. Thus, you can avoid taking the square root of each distance calculation, simplifying the process.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that you perform each multiplication and addition accurately to avoid errors in determining the farthest point.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently and accurately determine which point is farthest from the origin."}
