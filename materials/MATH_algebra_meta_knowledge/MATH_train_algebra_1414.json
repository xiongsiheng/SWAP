{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation Definition:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation \\( Z \\). In this case, \\( a Z b = b + 10a - a^2 \\). Make sure you apply the operation correctly by substituting the given values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into the operation, ensure that you substitute both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) correctly. Misplacing or misunderstanding the values can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when calculating. In this operation, you should first square \\( a \\), then multiply \\( a \\) by 10, and finally add \\( b \\) to the result.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when squaring numbers and performing multiplications. Small arithmetic errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the result, it can be helpful to quickly review the steps to ensure all operations were performed correctly and no mistakes were made.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
