{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inequalities:** Recognize that the inequality \\(\\sqrt{x} > 2\\) translates to \\(x > 4\\) when squared, and \\(\\sqrt{x} < 4\\) translates to \\(x < 16\\) when squared.\n\n2. **Combining Inequalities:** Combine the inequalities \\(x > 4\\) and \\(x < 16\\) to find the range of \\(x\\) that satisfies both conditions.\n\n3. **Identifying Integer Solutions:** Once you have the range, identify all integer values within that range. This step requires careful counting to ensure no integers are missed or double-counted.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, verify each integer solution by substituting it back into the original inequalities to confirm it meets the conditions.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy in determining the number of integer solutions that satisfy the given condition."}
