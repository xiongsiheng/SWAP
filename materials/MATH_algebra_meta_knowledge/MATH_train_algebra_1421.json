{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Inequality Basics:** Understand the properties of inequalities, such as how multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.\n\n2. **Quadratic Inequalities:** When dealing with quadratic inequalities like \\(x^2 < 7x\\), first rewrite it in standard form \\(x^2 - 7x < 0\\). Then, factor the quadratic expression to find the critical points.\n\n3. **Critical Points:** Identify the roots of the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 7x = 0\\), which are the points where the expression equals zero. These roots divide the number line into intervals.\n\n4. **Interval Testing:** Test each interval determined by the critical points to determine where the inequality holds True. Substitute a value from each interval into the inequality to see if it satisfies the inequality.\n\n5. **Integer Solutions:** Once you have determined the intervals where the inequality is True, count the integer values within those intervals. Ensure you include or exclude endpoints based on whether the inequality is strict (<) or includes equality (<=).\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking a few integer values within the identified range to confirm the inequality holds for those values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
