{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying and analyzing polynomial expressions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly by multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms correctly. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n3. **Careful Arithmetic:** Perform arithmetic operations accurately, especially when dealing with negative signs and multiplications.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure correct simplification.\n\n5. **Coefficient Identification:** After simplifying, correctly identify the coefficients of each term. The coefficient is the numerical part of the term.\n\n6. **Sum of Squares Calculation:** When calculating the sum of the squares of the coefficients, ensure you square each coefficient correctly and then sum these squares.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can minimize errors in simplifying polynomial expressions and accurately determine the sum of the squares of the coefficients."}
