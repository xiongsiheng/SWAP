{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of a function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Restrictions:** The domain of a function includes all real numbers except where the function is undefined. For rational functions, this typically occurs where the denominator is zero.\n\n2. **Solve for Zero in Denominator:** To find where the function is undefined, set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\). For example, if the denominator is \\( x + 27 \\), set \\( x + 27 = 0 \\) and solve for \\( x \\), which gives \\( x = -27 \\).\n\n3. **Express Domain in Interval Notation:** Once you identify the points where the function is undefined, exclude these points from the set of all real numbers. The domain is then expressed as intervals of real numbers. For instance, if \\( x = -27 \\) makes the function undefined, the domain would be \\( (-\\infty, -27) \\cup (-27, \\infty) \\).\n\n4. **Check for Other Restrictions:** Ensure there are no other restrictions on \\( x \\) (such as complex number solutions or non-real results) that would further limit the domain.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the domain of a function expressed in interval notation."}
