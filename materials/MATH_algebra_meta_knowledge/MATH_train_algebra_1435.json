{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Properties:** Remember that the absolute value function, \\(|x|\\), always returns a non-negative value. This means \\(|4x|\\) can be either \\(4x\\) or \\(-4x\\), depending on the value of \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\(x\\):** When solving equations involving absolute values, you typically need to consider two cases: one where the expression inside the absolute value is positive, and one where it is negative. For example, \\(|4x| = 32\\) leads to \\(4x = 32\\) and \\(4x = -32\\).\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, always substitute them back into the original equation to verify they are correct. This step is crucial for catching any errors in the sign or calculation.\n\n4. **Product Calculation:** When calculating the product of the solutions, ensure you multiply the values correctly. Double-check your arithmetic to avoid simple mistakes.\n\n5. **Negative Products:** Be aware that the product of two numbers of opposite signs is negative. This is particularly relevant when one solution is positive and the other is negative.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
