{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the slope of a line perpendicular to another line, consider the following:\n\n1. **Calculate the Slope:** First, determine the slope of the given line using the formula \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the points on the line.\n\n2. **Perpendicular Slope:** The slope of a line perpendicular to another is the negative reciprocal of the original slope. If the slope of the original line is \\(m\\), then the slope of the perpendicular line is \\(-\\frac{1}{m}\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction:** Ensure that the slope is expressed as a simplified fraction. This involves reducing the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n4. **Check for Correctness:** Verify that the calculated slope is indeed the negative reciprocal of the original slope to avoid conceptual errors.\n\n5. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of sign errors and ensure that the numerator and denominator are correctly placed when finding the negative reciprocal.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy in finding the slope of a line perpendicular to a given line."}
