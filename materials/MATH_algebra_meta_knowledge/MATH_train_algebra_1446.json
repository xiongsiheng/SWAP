{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Vertices in a Rectangle:** In a rectangle, opposite vertices are directly opposite each other, meaning they share the same diagonals. The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other at the midpoint.\n\n2. **Midpoint Formula:** Use the midpoint formula to find the midpoint of the given vertices. The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n3. **Reflecting Points:** Once you have the midpoint, reflect the given vertices across this midpoint to find the coordinates of the other two vertices. Reflecting a point \\((x, y)\\) across the midpoint \\(\\left(a, b\\right)\\) results in the point \\(\\left(2a - x, 2b - y\\right)\\).\n\n4. **Sum of Coordinates:** After finding the coordinates of the other two vertices, sum their \\(y\\)-coordinates to get the required result.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations, especially those involving the midpoint and reflection, are done accurately to avoid errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
