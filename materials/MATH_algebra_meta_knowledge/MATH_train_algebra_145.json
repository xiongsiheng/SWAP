{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Zero Product Property:** Remember that if a product of two factors equals zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So, set each factor in the equation equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Solving Linear Equations:** When solving linear equations like \\( 3x + 5 = 0 \\) or \\( 2x - 9 = 0 \\), isolate \\( x \\) by performing the necessary arithmetic operations.\n\n3. **Sum of Solutions:** For quadratic equations in the form \\( (ax + b)(cx + d) = 0 \\), the sum of the solutions (roots) can be found directly by adding the solutions obtained from setting each factor to zero.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform arithmetic operations accurately, especially when adding or subtracting fractions, to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the sum of the solutions by substituting the individual solutions back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
