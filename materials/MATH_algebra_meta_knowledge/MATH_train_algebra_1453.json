{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the coordinates into the formula. Pay attention to the signs of the coordinates, especially when subtracting.\n\n3. **Squaring Differences:** When squaring the differences \\((x_2 - x_1)\\) and \\((y_2 - y_1)\\), remember that squaring always results in a positive number, regardless of the sign of the difference.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Square Root:** After calculating the square of the differences and summing them, take the square root of the result. Ensure that you simplify the square root correctly.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations step-by-step to catch any arithmetic errors, especially in the squaring and square root operations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating distances between points in a coordinate plane."}
