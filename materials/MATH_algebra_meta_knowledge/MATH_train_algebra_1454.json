{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Proportional Relationships:** Recognize that the relationship between the amount of flour and the number of cookies is proportional. This means that if the amount of flour increases, the number of cookies will increase proportionally.\n\n2. **Setting Up Ratios:** Use ratios to set up the problem. For example, if 18 cookies are made with 2 cups of flour, the ratio is 18 cookies : 2 cups of flour.\n\n3. **Cross-Multiplication or Direct Proportion:** To find the number of cookies for a different amount of flour, you can use cross-multiplication or set up a direct proportion equation.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that you perform multiplication and division accurately to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Checking Your Answer:** After calculating, verify your answer by ensuring it makes sense logically (e.g., more flour should yield more cookies) and by performing the calculation in a different way to confirm consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
