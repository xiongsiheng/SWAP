{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have only one solution, its discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by \\(b^2 - 4ac\\).\n\n2. **Identifying Coefficients:** In the given equation \\(4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0\\), identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly. Here, \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = a + 8\\), and \\(c = 9\\).\n\n3. **Setting the Discriminant to Zero:** Set the discriminant equal to zero and solve for \\(a\\). This involves solving the equation \\((a + 8)^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 9 = 0\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(a\\):** Solve the resulting equation for \\(a\\) to find the values that make the discriminant zero.\n\n5. **Sum of Values:** Once you find the two values of \\(a\\), calculate their sum. This is typically the required answer in such problems.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify by substituting the values of \\(a\\) back into the original equation to ensure they result in a quadratic with only one solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
