{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing the square of a number without a calculator, consider the following:\n\n1. **Use Algebraic Identities:** Apply algebraic identities such as the binomial theorem or the difference of squares formula to simplify calculations. For example, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n2. **Break Down the Number:** Decompose the number into more manageable parts. For instance, if you need to square 1017, you might consider it as \\(1000 + 17\\) and then apply the binomial theorem.\n\n3. **Check Calculations Step-by-Step:** Perform calculations step-by-step and double-check each step to ensure accuracy. This includes careful addition, multiplication, and squaring of numbers.\n\n4. **Estimate and Verify:** Make a rough estimate to ensure your final answer is reasonable. For example, the square of 1000 is 1,000,000, so the square of 1017 should be slightly more than that.\n\n5. **Practice Mental Math:** Regularly practice mental math to improve speed and accuracy, which can help reduce errors in complex calculations.\n\nThese strategies will help minimize errors and improve the accuracy of your computations."}
