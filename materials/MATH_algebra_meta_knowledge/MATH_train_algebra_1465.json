{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation given, in this case, $x@y = xy - 2x$. Ensure you apply this operation correctly for each pair of values.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** When evaluating expressions, follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). For this problem, first calculate the operation $x@y$ for each pair, then perform the subtraction.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Commutative Properties:** Check if the operation is commutative (i.e., if $x@y = y@x$). This can simplify calculations and help avoid mistakes.\n\n4. **Careful Substitution:** When substituting values into the operation, be meticulous to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After calculating each part of the expression, double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with negative numbers or complex expressions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
