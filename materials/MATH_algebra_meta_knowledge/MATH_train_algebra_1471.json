{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Integer Constraints:** Ensure that both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers. This constraint will guide your search for solutions.\n\n2. **Linear Equations:** Understand that for a linear equation like \\( 5x + 3y = 100 \\), the solutions form a line in the \\( xy \\)-plane. You need to find points on this line where both coordinates are integers.\n\n3. **Maximizing Product:** To maximize \\( xy \\), consider the geometric interpretation: the product \\( xy \\) is the area of a rectangle with sides \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Maximizing this area involves finding the right balance between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n4. **Systematic Search:** Start with the largest possible value of \\( x \\) (since \\( 5x \\) must be less than or equal to 100) and work downwards, checking if \\( y \\) is a positive integer for each \\( x \\). This systematic approach helps avoid missing potential solutions.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding a candidate for the maximum \\( xy \\), verify that it satisfies the original equation and that both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are indeed positive integers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
