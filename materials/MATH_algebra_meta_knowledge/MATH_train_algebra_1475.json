{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating logarithmic expressions like $\\log_4 64$, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Form:** Recall that $\\log_b a = c$ means $b^c = a$. This fundamental definition is crucial for solving logarithmic equations.\n\n2. **Recognizing Powers:** Identify if the number inside the logarithm is a perfect power of the base. For example, $64$ is $4^3$, which simplifies the logarithm directly.\n\n3. **Using Properties of Logarithms:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as $\\log_b (b^c) = c$, which can simplify the evaluation process.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that you correctly identified the power relationship and applied the logarithmic properties accurately.\n\n5. **Consistency in Base:** Ensure that the base of the logarithm matches the base of the exponent in the equivalent exponential form. This consistency is key to finding the correct answer.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can minimize errors and accurately evaluate logarithmic expressions."}
