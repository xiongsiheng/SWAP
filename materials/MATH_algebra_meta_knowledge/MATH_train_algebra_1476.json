{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up the Equation:** Ensure that you correctly translate the problem into an algebraic equation. For this problem, if the numerator is \\( x \\), then the denominator is \\( 3x - 7 \\). The fraction \\( \frac{x}{3x - 7} \\) should be set equal to \\( \frac{2}{5} \\).\n\n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** When you cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\), make sure you multiply correctly. For example, \\( \frac{x}{3x - 7} = \frac{2}{5} \\) leads to \\( 5x = 2(3x - 7) \\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Be meticulous when solving linear equations. Distribute and combine like terms carefully to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding a value for \\( x \\), substitute it back into the original setup to verify that the fraction indeed equals \\( \frac{2}{5} \\). This step ensures that the solution is correct and meets the conditions of the problem.\n\n5. **Understanding Fractions:** Remember the properties of fractions, such as how changes in the numerator and denominator affect the value of the fraction. This understanding helps in setting up and solving the equation accurately.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
