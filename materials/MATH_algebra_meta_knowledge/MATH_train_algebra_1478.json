{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Use the substitution method when one variable is expressed in terms of another. In this case, since \\( s \\) is two less than \\( t \\), you can express \\( s \\) as \\( t - 2 \\).\n\n2. **Algebraic Manipulation:** When substituting \\( s \\) into the first equation, ensure you correctly substitute and simplify the equation. This involves replacing \\( s \\) with \\( t - 2 \\) in the equation \\( 9s + 5t = 108 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** After substitution, solve the resulting linear equation for \\( t \\). This typically involves isolating \\( t \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Once you find a value for \\( t \\), substitute it back into the original equations to verify that it satisfies both conditions. This step is crucial to ensure that the solution is correct and not the result of a calculation error.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients during substitution and simplification to avoid common algebraic mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
