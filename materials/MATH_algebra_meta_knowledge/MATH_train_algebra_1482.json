{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( s(t(x)) \\) means you first apply the function \\( t \\) to \\( x \\), and then apply the function \\( s \\) to the result of \\( t(x) \\). Ensure you correctly substitute and evaluate the functions in the correct order.\n\n2. **Solving for \\( x \\) in \\( t(x) \\):** If you need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( t(x) = 1 \\), solve the equation \\( 3x - 8 = 1 \\). This involves basic algebraic manipulation to isolate \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Substitution into \\( s(x) \\):** Once you find the value of \\( x \\) that makes \\( t(x) = 1 \\), substitute this \\( x \\) into \\( s(x) \\) to find \\( s(1) \\). Ensure you substitute correctly and perform the arithmetic accurately.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing substitutions and calculations, double-check your steps to ensure no arithmetic errors were made.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your result by checking if \\( s(t(x)) \\) indeed equals \\( x^2 + 3x - 2 \\) for the value of \\( x \\) you found. This step is useful for confirming the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
