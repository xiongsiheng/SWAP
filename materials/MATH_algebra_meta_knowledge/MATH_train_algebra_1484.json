{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding this type of product, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly, which means multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside the parentheses. For example, \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\).\n\n2. **Fraction Multiplication:** When multiplying fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. For example, \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{a \\times c}{b \\times d}\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Terms:** After distributing, simplify each term by canceling common factors in the numerator and the denominator, if possible.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations such as multiplication and addition are performed accurately to avoid errors in the final expression.\n\n5. **Checking Work:** After expanding, it can be helpful to check your work by substituting a simple value for \\(x\\) and verifying that both the original and expanded expressions yield the same result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding such products."}
