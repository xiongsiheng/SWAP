{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents and Roots:** Recognize that taking the nth root of a number is equivalent to raising that number to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\). For example, \\(\\sqrt[4]{81}\\) is the same as \\(81^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Exponents:** When multiplying numbers with different roots, convert the roots to fractional exponents and then multiply the exponents. For example, \\(\\sqrt[4]{81} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{27}\\) can be rewritten as \\(81^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\cdot 27^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\).\n\n3. **Combining Exponents:** Use the property of exponents that states \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) to combine the exponents. This will simplify the expression.\n\n4. **Calculating Exponents:** After combining the exponents, calculate the resulting exponent to find the final value. Ensure that the base is raised to the correct power.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and roots, as these operations can be prone to errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
