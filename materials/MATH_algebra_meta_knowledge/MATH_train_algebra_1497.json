{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral. The distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Recognizing Special Triangles:** Be aware of right triangles and their properties. For example, if the differences in coordinates form a 45-45-90 or 30-60-90 triangle, you can use the known ratios of their sides.\n\n3. **Simplifying Square Roots:** When calculating distances, you may encounter expressions involving square roots. Simplify these expressions carefully to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Summing Perimeters:** After calculating the lengths of all sides, sum them up. Ensure that you correctly combine like terms involving square roots.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for each side length and the final perimeter to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
