{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Quadratic Functions:** Recognize that the given expression \\(n^2 - 9n + 18\\) is a quadratic function. The sign of a quadratic function \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) depends on its discriminant and the direction of its parabola (upward or downward).\n\n2. **Finding the Roots:** Calculate the roots of the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(n = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). These roots determine the intervals where the function is positive, negative, or zero.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Roots:** Once the roots are found, understand that the quadratic function changes sign at these points. For \\(n^2 - 9n + 18\\) to be negative, \\(n\\) must lie between the roots if the parabola opens upwards.\n\n4. **Testing Intervals:** Test the intervals defined by the roots to determine where the function is negative. This involves selecting a value within each interval and substituting it back into the function.\n\n5. **Integer Constraints:** Since the problem asks for the largest integer value, ensure that your final answer is an integer and that it lies within the correct interval where the function is negative.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
