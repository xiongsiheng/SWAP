{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Area and Perimeter:** Recognize that the area of a square is given by \\( \text{side}^2 \\) and the perimeter by \\( 4 \times \text{side} \\). For a given area, the side length that minimizes the perimeter (amount of fencing) is the square root of the area.\n\n2. **Calculating Square Roots:** Accurately calculate the square root of the given area (400 square feet in this case) to determine the side length. Use a calculator or a precise method to avoid rounding errors.\n\n3. **Rounding Correctly:** When dealing with practical applications like fencing, ensure you round up to the nearest whole number if the calculated side length is not a whole number, as partial feet cannot be measured in practice.\n\n4. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify your calculations by squaring the side length to ensure it returns the original area requirement (400 square feet).\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure that your final answer makes logical sense in the context of the problem, i.e., the side length should be a reasonable value for a piece of land.\n\nThese points will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving problems involving area and perimeter of squares."}
