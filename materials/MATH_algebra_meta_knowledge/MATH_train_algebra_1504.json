{"Knowledge": "To solve this problem accurately, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Exponential Growth:** The population of amoebas grows exponentially because each amoeba splits into two every day. This means the number of amoebas doubles each day.\n\n2. **Initial Condition:** Start with one amoeba on the first day.\n\n3. **Daily Doubling:** Each day, the total number of amoebas is twice the number from the previous day.\n\n4. **Week Calculation:** A week consists of seven days. To find the total number of amoebas after one week, calculate the population for each day and multiply by 2 for each subsequent day.\n\n5. **Formula Application:** You can use the formula \\(2^n\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of days. For one week (7 days), calculate \\(2^7\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the number of amoebas is correctly doubling each day and that the final calculation is accurate.\n\nThese points will help you avoid common errors and ensure the correct calculation of the amoeba population after one week."}
