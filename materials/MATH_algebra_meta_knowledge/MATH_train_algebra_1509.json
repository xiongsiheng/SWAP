{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Square Roots and Fractions:** When dealing with fractions involving square roots, ensure that the denominator is rationalized and simplified correctly. This often involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\n2. **Isolating Variables:** Isolate the variable \\( x \\) by performing algebraic operations carefully. For instance, if you need to square both sides to eliminate the square roots, remember that this might introduce extraneous solutions.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation. This step is crucial to ensure that the solution is not only mathematically correct but also satisfies the original conditions of the problem.\n\n4. **Simplification Techniques:** Use proper simplification techniques for algebraic expressions. For example, when dealing with square roots, simplify \\(\\sqrt{ab}\\) as \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\) provided \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are non-negative.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to detail, especially when dealing with signs and operations. Small mistakes in signs or operations can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
