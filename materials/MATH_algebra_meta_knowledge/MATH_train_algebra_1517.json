{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the sum of a geometric series, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series:** The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series with the first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) (where \\( |r| < 1 \\)) is given by \\( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \\).\n\n2. **Identifying the First Term and Common Ratio:** Ensure you correctly identify the first term \\( a \\) and the common ratio \\( r \\) of the series. In this case, \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( r = \frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Checking the Convergence Condition:** Verify that the absolute value of the common ratio \\( r \\) is less than 1 to ensure the series converges.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Denominator:** When applying the formula, simplify the denominator \\( 1 - r \\) correctly to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Double-check your calculations, especially the simplification of the fraction, to ensure the final answer is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
