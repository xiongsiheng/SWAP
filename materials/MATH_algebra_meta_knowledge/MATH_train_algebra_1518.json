{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying the Equation:** Start by simplifying both sides of the equation. Combine like terms and ensure all terms are on one side of the equation to set it to zero.\n\n2. **Factoring Quadratics:** When dealing with quadratic equations, practice factoring techniques to express the equation in a product of two binomials. This can help in finding the roots more easily.\n\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring is not straightforward, use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where the equation is in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, ensure that each solution satisfies the original equation. Sometimes, solutions obtained might not satisfy the original conditions of the problem.\n\n5. **Identifying the Smallest Value:** Once you have all possible solutions, compare them to find the smallest value. This step is crucial as the problem specifically asks for the smallest possible value of \\(x\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
