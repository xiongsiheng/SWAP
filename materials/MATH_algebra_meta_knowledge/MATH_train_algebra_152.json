{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection points of two parabolas, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Equations Equal:** To find the points of intersection, set the equations of the parabolas equal to each other. This step is crucial as it directly leads to the solution of the system of equations.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When solving the resulting quadratic equation, use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) or factorize if possible. Ensure that you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n3. **Checking for Real Solutions:** Calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to determine if there are real solutions. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real intersections.\n\n4. **Substitution for Y-Coordinates:** Once you find the x-coordinates of the intersection points, substitute these values back into either original equation to find the corresponding y-coordinates.\n\n5. **Ordering Points:** Ensure that the points are listed in order of increasing x-coordinate, as specified in the problem.\n\n6. **Precision in Calculations:** Be precise in your calculations to avoid rounding errors, especially when dealing with square roots in the quadratic formula.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
