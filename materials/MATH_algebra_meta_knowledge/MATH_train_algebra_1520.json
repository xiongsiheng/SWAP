{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the domain of a function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Denominator Zeros:** The domain of a rational function is all real numbers except where the denominator is zero. Find the values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero and exclude them from the domain.\n\n2. **Factorization:** Factor both the numerator and the denominator if possible. This can help in identifying common factors and simplifying the function, which in turn helps in determining the domain.\n\n3. **Quadratic Equations:** For quadratic expressions in the denominator, solve for \\( x \\) using the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). The solutions to \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) are the points where the function is undefined.\n\n4. **Check for Common Factors:** After factoring, check if the numerator and denominator have common factors. If they do, these factors can be canceled out, but remember to still exclude the roots of these canceled factors from the domain.\n\n5. **Graphical Representation:** Optionally, plotting the function can provide a visual check of the domain, especially around points where the function might behave unexpectedly due to asymptotes or discontinuities.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can more accurately determine the domain of a rational function."}
