{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand what the problem is asking. In this case, you need to find two 2-digit integers such that their average equals a decimal number formed by placing one integer before the decimal point and the other after it.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations. For example, if the two integers are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the problem can be expressed as \\(\frac{a + b}{2} = \text{decimal number formed by } a.b\\).\n\n3. **Decimal Representation:** Be precise in how you represent the decimal number. For instance, if \\(a = 12\\) and \\(b = 34\\), the decimal number would be \\(12.34\\).\n\n4. **Solving for Integers:** Use algebraic manipulation to solve for the integers. This might involve setting up and solving equations, possibly with constraints that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2-digit numbers.\n\n5. **Checking Constraints:** Ensure that both integers are within the range of 10 to 99, as they are 2-digit numbers.\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding the integers, verify that the average of the two integers matches the decimal number formed by their specified arrangement.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
