{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Recall the midpoint formula, which states that the midpoint \\( M \\) of a segment with endpoints \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) is given by \\( M\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for the coordinates of the unknown endpoint. For example, if the midpoint is \\( (6, -10) \\) and one endpoint is \\( (8, 0) \\), you can set up the equations \\( \frac{8 + x_2}{2} = 6 \\) and \\( \frac{0 + y_2}{2} = -10 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Coordinates:** Solve the equations for \\( x_2 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) by isolating the variables. For instance, from \\( \frac{8 + x_2}{2} = 6 \\), you get \\( 8 + x_2 = 12 \\), thus \\( x_2 = 4 \\). Similarly, solve for \\( y_2 \\).\n\n4. **Sum of Coordinates:** Once you have the coordinates of the other endpoint, add them together to find the sum. Ensure you add both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate correctly.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations step-by-step to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. This includes checking the application of the midpoint formula and the correctness of the final sum.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
