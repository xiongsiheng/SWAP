{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( k \\) in a quadratic equation with given roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula for the roots of \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\): \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). This formula directly relates the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) to the roots of the equation.\n\n2. **Matching Roots:** When given the roots in a specific form, match the given roots to the form of the quadratic formula. For example, if the roots are given as \\( \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{D}}{2a} \\), compare this with the given roots to identify \\( D \\).\n\n3. **Discriminant:** The term under the square root in the quadratic formula, \\( b^2 - 4ac \\), is known as the discriminant (\\( D \\)). For the roots to be in the form given, \\( D \\) must equal the square root term in the given roots.\n\n4. **Solving for \\( k \\):** Use the relationship \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\) to solve for \\( k \\). In this case, \\( a = 7 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = k \\). Set \\( D \\) equal to the value under the square root in the given roots and solve for \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find \\( k \\), substitute it back into the quadratic equation and use the quadratic formula to confirm that the roots match the given roots. This step ensures that your calculation of \\( k \\) is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( k \\) in such problems."}
