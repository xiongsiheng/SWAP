{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Symbolic Operations:** Ensure you clearly understand the operation denoted by the symbol (in this case, `&`). Define the operation explicitly before proceeding with calculations.\n\n2. **Substitution and Evaluation:** When dealing with nested operations, evaluate from the innermost operation outward. This helps in maintaining clarity and reducing errors.\n\n3. **Consistency in Operations:** Apply the defined operation consistently across all instances. Mixing up or incorrectly applying the operation can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Verification of Steps:** After performing each operation, verify that the steps were carried out correctly. This includes checking arithmetic and ensuring the operation was applied as defined.\n\n5. **Final Check:** Substitute the final result back into the original expressions or conditions to confirm its correctness. This step is crucial in catching any errors that might have occurred during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems involving symbolic or nested operations."}
