{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents:** Recognize that \\(2^8 - 1\\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored using the formula \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). In this case, \\(2^8 - 1 = (2^4 - 1)(2^4 + 1)\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:** When dealing with numbers, especially those derived from algebraic expressions, use known prime factorizations or check divisibility rules to identify prime factors. For example, \\(2^4 - 1 = 15\\) and \\(2^4 + 1 = 17\\).\n\n3. **Checking for Primes:** Ensure that each factor identified is indeed a prime number. Use known primes or simple divisibility tests to confirm.\n\n4. **Summing Primes:** After identifying the prime factors, add them together carefully to find the sum. Double-check the addition to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify the solution by checking if the product of the identified primes equals \\(2^8 - 1\\) and if their sum matches the calculated result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
