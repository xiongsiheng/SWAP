{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\(a\\) in a geometric sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequence:** A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, denoted as \\(r\\).\n\n2. **Formulating the Ratio:** Use the property of geometric sequences where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. For example, \\(\frac{a}{140} = \frac{\frac{45}{28}}{a}\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(a\\):** Set up the equation using the ratio property and solve for \\(a\\). Ensure that you correctly cross-multiply and simplify the equation.\n\n4. **Checking for Positive Solutions:** Since \\(a\\) is specified to be positive, ensure your solution adheres to this condition.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the value of \\(a\\) back into the sequence to verify that the terms maintain the correct geometric ratio.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
