{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recall that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. If the first term is \\(a_1\\) and the common difference is \\(d\\), then the \\(n\\)-th term can be expressed as \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\).\n\n2. **Using Given Information:** Utilize the given product \\(a_4a_5 = 13\\) to find possible values for \\(a_4\\) and \\(a_5\\). Since 13 is a prime number, the possible pairs \\((a_4, a_5)\\) are limited to \\((1, 13)\\) and \\((13, 1)\\), considering the sequence is increasing.\n\n3. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the chosen pair fits the arithmetic sequence properties. For example, if \\(a_4 = 1\\) and \\(a_5 = 13\\), check if \\(a_5 - a_4 = d\\) is consistent with the sequence being increasing and integer-valued.\n\n4. **Calculating Other Terms:** Once \\(a_4\\) and \\(a_5\\) are determined, use the common difference \\(d\\) to find \\(a_3\\) and \\(a_6\\). For instance, if \\(a_4 = 1\\) and \\(a_5 = 13\\), then \\(d = 12\\), and thus \\(a_3 = a_4 - d\\) and \\(a_6 = a_5 + d\\).\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Multiply \\(a_3\\) and \\(a_6\\) to find \\(a_3a_6\\) and verify that the calculations are correct. This step ensures that all previous steps were performed accurately.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
