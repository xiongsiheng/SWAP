{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex numbers in this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:** When subtracting complex numbers, handle the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. This helps avoid mixing them up.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that you perform subtraction accurately, especially with negative signs. For example, subtracting a positive number from another positive number can easily lead to sign errors if not handled carefully.\n\n3. **Simplification Check:** After performing the subtraction, double-check that the result is in the standard form of a complex number, which is \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n4. **Consistency in Notation:** Use consistent notation for complex numbers, typically \\(a + bi\\), to avoid confusion between the real and imaginary components.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure the correct simplification of complex numbers."}
