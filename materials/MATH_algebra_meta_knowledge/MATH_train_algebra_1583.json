{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** Recall that for a quadratic polynomial \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) with roots \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\), Vieta's formulas state that \\(r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a}\\) and \\(r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \frac{c}{a}\\). In this problem, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\), and \\(c = t\\), so \\(r_1 + r_2 = 5\\) and \\(r_1 \\cdot r_2 = t\\).\n\n2. **Positive Integer Roots:** Since the roots are positive integers, consider pairs of positive integers that sum to 5. These pairs are (1, 4) and (2, 3).\n\n3. **Calculating \\(t\\):** For each pair of roots, calculate \\(t\\) by multiplying the roots. For (1, 4), \\(t = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4\\); for (2, 3), \\(t = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\).\n\n4. **Average Calculation:** To find the average of all distinct possible values of \\(t\\), sum the distinct values and divide by the number of distinct values. Here, the distinct values are 4 and 6, so the average is \\(\frac{4 + 6}{2} = 5\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations for the roots and the values of \\(t\\) to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with integer constraints and simple arithmetic operations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
