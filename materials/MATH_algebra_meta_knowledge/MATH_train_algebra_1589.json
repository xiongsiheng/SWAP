{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the common ratio of an infinite geometric series, consider the following:\n\n1. **Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series:** The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is \\( S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio. Remember that \\( |r| < 1 \\) for the series to converge.\n\n2. **Rearranging the Formula:** To find the common ratio \\( r \\), rearrange the sum formula to solve for \\( r \\): \\( r = 1 - \\frac{a}{S} \\).\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations when dividing \\( a \\) by \\( S \\) and subtracting from 1. Small errors in division or subtraction can significantly affect the result.\n\n4. **Checking the Range of \\( r \\):** Verify that the calculated \\( r \\) is within the acceptable range \\( |r| < 1 \\) to confirm the series converges.\n\n5. **Double-Checking the Solution:** Substitute the calculated \\( r \\) back into the sum formula to ensure it matches the given sum of the series, which helps to catch any computational errors.\n\nThese guidelines will help minimize errors and ensure accurate determination of the common ratio in infinite geometric series."}
