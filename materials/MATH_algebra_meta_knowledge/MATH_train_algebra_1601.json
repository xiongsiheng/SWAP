{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the given information. For example, if the integers are \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), you have \\(x^2 + y^2 = 90\\) and \\(xy = 27\\).\n\n2. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Utilize algebraic identities to simplify the problem. For instance, you can use the identity \\((x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\\) to find the sum of the integers.\n\n3. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve the system of equations. Substitute \\(xy = 27\\) into the identity mentioned above to find \\(x + y\\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when squaring numbers and adding or subtracting large values, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), verify that they satisfy both the original equations to ensure correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
