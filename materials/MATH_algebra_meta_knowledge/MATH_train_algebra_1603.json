{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this system of linear equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Elimination Method:** When using the elimination method to solve for variables, ensure that you multiply each equation by the correct factor so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same. This will allow you to subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** If you choose to use the substitution method, solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other, and then substitute this expression into the other equation. Be careful with algebraic manipulations to avoid errors.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with large numbers or fractions. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Verification:** Once you find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), substitute them back into both original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\n5. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify expressions as much as possible before proceeding with further calculations. This can help in identifying patterns or simplifications that might not be apparent in the original form of the equations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
