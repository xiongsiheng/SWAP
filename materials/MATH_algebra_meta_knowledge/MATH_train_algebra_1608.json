{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Isolate the Radical:** Ensure the radical term is isolated on one side of the equation before proceeding with any operations.\n\n2. **Square Both Sides:** When you square both sides of an equation, you might introduce extraneous solutions. Always check your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.\n\n3. **Simplify Correctly:** After squaring, simplify the resulting equation carefully, ensuring that you correctly handle the arithmetic operations.\n\n4. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, substitute them back into the original equation to verify they are indeed solutions and not extraneous.\n\n5. **Understand the Domain:** Consider the domain of the original equation, which in this case requires that the expression under the square root (5 + 2z) must be non-negative.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
