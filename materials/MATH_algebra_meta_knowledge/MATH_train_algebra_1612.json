{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Timeframes:** Clearly identify the total planned time and the time lost due to unforeseen circumstances. In this case, the original plan was for 12 weeks, and 2 weeks were lost due to sickness.\n\n2. **Calculating Remaining Time:** Determine the remaining time available to work by subtracting the lost time from the original total time. Here, you subtract the 2 lost weeks from the 12 weeks.\n\n3. **Maintaining Earnings Goal:** Ensure that the total earnings goal remains constant. In this scenario, the goal is to still earn $3000.\n\n4. **Adjusting Work Hours:** Calculate the new number of hours needed per week to achieve the earnings goal within the reduced timeframe. This involves dividing the total earnings goal by the remaining number of weeks and then by the number of hours per week.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations by ensuring that the new weekly hours, when multiplied by the remaining weeks, will indeed meet the earnings goal. This step helps catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
