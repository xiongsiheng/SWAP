{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Conjugates:** Recognize that pairs like \\((\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b})\\) and \\((\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b})\\) are conjugates. The product of a conjugate pair is always \\(a - b\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Products:** When multiplying expressions involving square roots, use the property \\((\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b})(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b}) = a - b\\). This simplifies calculations significantly.\n\n3. **Handling Multiple Products:** When calculating the product of multiple terms involving square roots, pair conjugates first to simplify the expression before multiplying the simplified results.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to the signs and values when multiplying and simplifying expressions, as errors often occur in these steps.\n\n5. **Verification:** Although not always feasible, if possible, verify your final answer by checking if it aligns with the expected properties of the given expressions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
