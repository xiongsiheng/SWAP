{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages:** Ensure you correctly interpret the percentage given. In this case, 10% of the total cost was paid upfront.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the information provided to set up an equation. Here, you know that $150 is 10% of the total cost, so you can write the equation as \\(0.10 \times \text{Total Cost} = 150$.\n\n3. **Solving for the Total Cost:** Isolate the variable representing the total cost by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.10.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After solving for the total cost, verify your calculation by checking if 10% of the calculated total cost indeed equals $150.\n\n5. **Use of Decimal Equivalents:** When dealing with percentages, use their decimal equivalents (e.g., 10% as 0.10) to avoid errors in multiplication.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
