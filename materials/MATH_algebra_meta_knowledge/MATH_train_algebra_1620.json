{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of a function, especially one involving a fraction and a square root, consider the following:\n\n1. **Denominator Rule:** The denominator of a fraction cannot be zero. Therefore, for \\( f(x) = \frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}} \\), the expression inside the square root, \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 \\), must not be zero.\n\n2. **Square Root Rule:** The expression inside a square root must be non-negative. Thus, \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 \\) must be greater than zero.\n\n3. **Solving Inequalities:** To find the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \\), solve the inequality by factoring the quadratic expression and determining the intervals where the product of the factors is positive.\n\n4. **Factoring Quadratics:** Factor \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 \\) as \\( (x - 4)(x + 1) \\). Determine the sign of the product in the intervals defined by the roots \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\).\n\n5. **Interval Analysis:** Use a sign chart or test points in each interval to determine where \\( (x - 4)(x + 1) > 0 \\). This will give you the domain of the function.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the domain of the function, avoiding common errors related to understanding the constraints imposed by the square root and the denominator."}
