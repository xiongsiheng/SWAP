{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Division with Remainder:** Recall the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (with \\(b \neq 0\\)), there exist unique integers \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) such that \\(a = bq + r\\) and \\(0 \\leq r < b\\). In this context, \\(n = dq + r\\) where \\(q\\) is the quotient and \\(r\\) is the remainder.\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting expressions for \\(n\\) and \\(d\\), ensure that you simplify correctly. For instance, \\(n = x^2 + 2x + 17\\) and \\(d = 2x + 5\\) should be substituted and simplified step by step.\n\n3. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Since \\(x\\) is a positive integer, ensure that your final solution is indeed an integer and meets the condition \\(x > 0\\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting \\(x\\) back into the expressions for \\(n\\) and \\(d\\) to confirm that the division conditions (quotient and remainder) are satisfied.\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as incorrect algebraic manipulations or overlooking the integer constraint on \\(x\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
