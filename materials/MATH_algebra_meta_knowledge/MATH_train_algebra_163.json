{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have exactly one solution, the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) must be zero. In this case, \\(b = 20\\), so \\(20^2 - 4ac = 0\\) simplifies to \\(400 - 4ac = 0\\) or \\(ac = 100\\).\n\n2. **System of Equations:** You have two equations: \\(a + c = 29\\) and \\(ac = 100\\). Solve these simultaneously to find \\(a\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Formula for System:** Treat \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) as variables in a quadratic equation. From \\(a + c = 29\\), express \\(c\\) as \\(29 - a\\). Substitute into \\(ac = 100\\) to get a quadratic in \\(a\\): \\(a(29 - a) = 100\\), which simplifies to \\(a^2 - 29a + 100 = 0\\).\n\n4. **Solving the Quadratic:** Use the quadratic formula \\(a = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to solve \\(a^2 - 29a + 100 = 0\\). Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -29\\), and \\(c = 100\\).\n\n5. **Checking Constraints:** Ensure that \\(a < c\\) is satisfied with the solutions found. This step is crucial to ensure the correct ordered pair.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the values of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) back into the original conditions to verify they satisfy all given constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
