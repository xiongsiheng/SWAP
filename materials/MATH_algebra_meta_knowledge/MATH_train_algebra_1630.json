{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of a sequence of negative numbers, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Type:** Recognize that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each term decreases by a constant amount (in this case, by 2).\n\n2. **Use the Arithmetic Series Formula:** The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a + l)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Terms:** Ensure you correctly count the number of terms in the sequence. For a sequence starting at \\(a\\) and ending at \\(l\\) with a common difference \\(d\\), the number of terms \\(n\\) is given by \\(n = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1\\).\n\n4. **Handle Negative Numbers Carefully:** When dealing with negative numbers, ensure that you maintain the correct signs during calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verify the Result:** After calculating the sum, it can be helpful to verify the result by checking if the sum of the first few terms aligns with the pattern observed.\n\nThese guidelines will help minimize errors in calculating the sum of such sequences."}
