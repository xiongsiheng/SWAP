{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Define Variables:** Assign variables to unknown quantities to make the problem easier to handle algebraically. For example, let \\( A \\) be the price of a sack of apples, \\( B \\) be the price of a bunch of bananas, \\( C \\) be the price of a cantaloupe, and \\( D \\) be the price of a carton of dates.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:** Use the information given to set up equations. For instance, if the total cost is $20, you can write \\( A + B + C + D = 20 \\). Also, use the relationships between the prices to form additional equations, such as \\( D = 2A \\) and \\( C = A - B \\).\n\n3. **Substitute and Simplify:** Substitute the expressions from the relationships into the total cost equation to simplify and solve for the variables. This step often involves eliminating variables by substitution.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy. Simple mistakes can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:** Once you find the values of the variables, verify that they satisfy all the original conditions of the problem. This step ensures that your solution is correct and consistent with the problem's constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
