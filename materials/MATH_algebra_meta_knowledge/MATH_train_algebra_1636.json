{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Difference:** Determine the common difference in the arithmetic sequence by subtracting the first term from the second term. In this case, the common difference is \\( -2 - (-8) = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Formula for the nth Term:** Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, \\( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\), where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, \\( d \\) is the common difference, and \\( n \\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Calculate Specific Terms:** Substitute the values of \\( n \\) (2000 and 2005) into the formula to find the respective terms.\n\n4. **Difference Between Terms:** Subtract the 2000th term from the 2005th term to find the positive difference.\n\n5. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for the terms and the difference to ensure accuracy, as arithmetic errors are common in such problems.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
