{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying cube roots and finding the sum of coefficients, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:** Begin by performing prime factorization on the number inside the cube root. This helps in identifying perfect cubes and simplifying the expression.\n\n2. **Extracting Perfect Cubes:** Identify and extract all perfect cubes from the prime factorization. For example, if you have \\(2700 = 2^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^2\\), you can extract \\(3^3\\) as a perfect cube.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Expression:** After extracting perfect cubes, simplify the remaining part under the cube root. Ensure that the remaining number under the cube root (\\(b\\)) is as small as possible.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum:** Once you have determined \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), calculate \\(a + b\\). Double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your simplified form by calculating the cube of \\(a\\sqrt[3]{b}\\) and ensuring it equals the original number. This step is useful for catching any errors in the simplification process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
