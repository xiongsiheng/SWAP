{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** Recall that the inverse of a function \\( f(x) \\) is a function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) such that \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\). This relationship is crucial for setting up equations.\n\n2. **Substitution and Equivalence:** Use the definition of the inverse function to set up equations. For example, if \\( f(x) = ax + b \\), then \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = a(bx + a) + b \\) should equal \\( x \\). Similarly, \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = b(ax + b) + a \\) should also equal \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Once you have set up the equations from the inverse relationship, solve them simultaneously to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Be careful with algebraic manipulations to avoid errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), substitute them back into the original functions and their inverses to ensure they satisfy the conditions given in the problem.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and coefficients in your equations, as mistakes in these areas can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
