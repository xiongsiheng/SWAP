{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have rational solutions, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be a perfect square. In this case, \\(a = k\\), \\(b = 20\\), and \\(c = k\\), so the discriminant is \\(20^2 - 4k^2 = 400 - 4k^2\\).\n\n2. **Perfect Square Check:** Ensure that \\(400 - 4k^2\\) is a perfect square. This means \\(400 - 4k^2 = n^2\\) for some integer \\(n\\). Solve for \\(k\\) by checking values that make \\(400 - 4k^2\\) a perfect square.\n\n3. **Integer Values of \\(k\\):** Since \\(k\\) must be a positive integer, systematically test integer values of \\(k\\) to find which ones satisfy the condition that \\(400 - 4k^2\\) is a perfect square.\n\n4. **Verification:** After identifying possible values of \\(k\\), verify each by substituting back into the discriminant condition to confirm they yield rational solutions.\n\n5. **Order of Solutions:** Present your answers in increasing order as requested.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
