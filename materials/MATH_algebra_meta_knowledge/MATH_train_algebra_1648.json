{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( q(p(x)) \\) means you first apply the function \\( p \\) to \\( x \\), and then apply the function \\( q \\) to the result. Ensure you correctly identify the values of \\( p(x) \\) from the graph before using them as inputs for \\( q(x) \\).\n\n2. **Graph Interpretation:** Accurately read the values of \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) from the graph. Pay attention to the scale and the units of the grid, as misreading coordinates can lead to incorrect values.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** When calculating \\( q(p(x)) \\), perform each arithmetic operation carefully. Small errors in calculation can accumulate and lead to a significantly incorrect sum.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, double-check each \\( q(p(x)) \\) calculation by verifying the intermediate \\( p(x) \\) values against the graph. This step can help catch misinterpretations or calculation errors.\n\n5. **Summation:** After calculating each \\( q(p(x)) \\) value, sum them accurately. Ensure no values are omitted or duplicated in the summation process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
