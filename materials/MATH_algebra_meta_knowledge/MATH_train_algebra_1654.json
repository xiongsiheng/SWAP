{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function:** Ensure you fully understand the function \\( f(x) = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\). This function describes a semicircle shifted upwards by 1 unit.\n\n2. **Graphical Interpretation:** Recognize that the graph of \\( x = f(y) \\) is a reflection of the original function across the line \\( y = x \\). This reflection will create a symmetric shape.\n\n3. **Area Calculation:** To find the area of the enclosed region, you may need to integrate the function over a specified interval or use geometric properties of the shapes involved. For a semicircle, the area formula is \\( \frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n4. **Symmetry and Overlap:** Use symmetry properties to simplify calculations. The overlapping region between the two graphs can be divided into simpler geometric shapes whose areas are easier to calculate.\n\n5. **Precision in Calculations:** When calculating areas, especially involving circles or semi-circles, ensure precise calculations of radii and use the correct formulas. Rounding should be done only at the final step to maintain accuracy.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the application of geometric formulas to ensure the accuracy of the area calculation. Rounding to the nearest hundredth should be done only after the final calculation is complete.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
