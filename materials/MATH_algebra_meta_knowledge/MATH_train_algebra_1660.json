{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding products of binomials, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly. Multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.\n\n2. **FOIL Method:** If you use the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last), ensure you apply it accurately. This method helps in multiplying the first terms, the outer terms, the inner terms, and the last terms of the binomials.\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms to simplify the expression. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying coefficients and adding or subtracting terms.\n\n5. **Check Your Work:** Double-check your expanded form by comparing it with the original binomials. Ensure that no terms are missing or duplicated.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding such products."}
