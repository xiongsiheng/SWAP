{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the equation of a parabola with given characteristics, consider the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Parabola:** The vertex form of a parabola with a vertical axis of symmetry is given by \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex.\n\n2. **Using the Vertex:** Substitute the given vertex coordinates \\((2, 4)\\) into the vertex form to get \\( y = a(x - 2)^2 + 4 \\).\n\n3. **Incorporating Another Point:** Use the additional point \\((1, 1)\\) to solve for \\(a\\). Substitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\) into the equation and solve for \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Converting to Standard Form:** Once you have determined \\(a\\), expand the vertex form to convert it into the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\n5. **Checking Consistency:** Ensure that the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are consistent with the given vertex and point. Recheck your calculations if there are discrepancies.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the given point back into your final equation to verify that it satisfies the equation, confirming the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in finding the equation of the parabola."}
