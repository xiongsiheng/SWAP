{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Work Rates:** Recognize that the total work done is a product of the number of workers and the time they work. If the number of workers decreases, the time required increases proportionally, assuming the work rate remains constant.\n\n2. **Proportionality:** Use the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time required. If the number of workers is reduced by a certain factor, the time required increases by the same factor.\n\n3. **Consistent Units:** Ensure that all units are consistent. For example, if the number of workers is given in whole numbers, the time should also be considered in whole units unless specified otherwise.\n\n4. **Simplifying Calculations:** Simplify the problem by considering the total work done initially and then redistributing it among the fewer number of workers.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the new time required, verify the result by checking if the total work (number of workers multiplied by days) remains consistent with the initial scenario.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
