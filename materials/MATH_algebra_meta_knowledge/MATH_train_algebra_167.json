{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation \\(\\star\\). In this case, \\(a \\star b = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{a+b}}{\\sqrt{a-b}}\\). Ensure you apply this correctly in the given equation.\n\n2. **Handling Fractions and Radicals:** Be meticulous when dealing with fractions and radicals. Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each step is logically consistent.\n\n3. **Isolating Variables:** When solving for a variable like \\(x\\), isolate it on one side of the equation. This often involves algebraic manipulation such as cross-multiplying or squaring both sides to eliminate radicals.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, verify that the solution satisfies the original equation. This is crucial when dealing with equations involving radicals, as they can sometimes yield extraneous solutions.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and operations, especially when dealing with differences under the radical (\\(\\sqrt{a-b}\\)). Incorrect handling of signs can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
