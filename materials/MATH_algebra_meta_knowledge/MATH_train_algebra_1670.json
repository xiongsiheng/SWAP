{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Distances:** Recall the formula for the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, which is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). This formula is crucial for calculating distances between points.\n\n2. **Vertical and Horizontal Distances:** Remember that the distance of a point from the x-axis is simply the absolute value of its y-coordinate, and similarly, the distance from the y-axis is the absolute value of its x-coordinate.\n\n3. **Using Given Information:** Utilize the given distances to set up equations. For example, if a point is 12 units from the x-axis, then \\(|y| = 12\\). If it is 10 units from the point (1,6), then \\(\\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-6)^2} = 10\\).\n\n4. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Combine the equations derived from the distances to solve for the coordinates (x, y). This might involve squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots.\n\n5. **Calculating Distance from Origin:** Once you have the coordinates (x, y), use the distance formula to find the distance from the origin, which is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\n6. **Checking Constraints:** Ensure that your solution satisfies all given constraints, such as \\(x > 1\\) in this case. This helps in filtering out incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
