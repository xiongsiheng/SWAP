{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rates:** Ensure you understand the relationship between distance, speed, and time. The formula to use is \\( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \\).\n\n2. **Units Conversion:** Be aware of the units used in the problem. If speed is given in miles per hour and you need the time in minutes, remember that 1 hour equals 60 minutes.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform division accurately to avoid calculation errors. In this case, dividing 1 mile by 4 miles per hour will give the time in hours, which then needs to be converted to minutes.\n\n4. **Double-Check Conversions:** After converting units, double-check your conversion to ensure it is correct. For example, ensure that converting hours to minutes is done by multiplying by 60.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating, verify your answer by ensuring it makes sense logically (e.g., it should take less than an hour for a squirrel to travel 1 mile at 4 miles per hour).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
