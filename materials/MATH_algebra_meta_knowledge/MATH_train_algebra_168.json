{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the least possible value of a quadratic function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** The minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\\).\n\n2. **Quadratic Coefficients:** Identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly from the quadratic equation. Misidentifying these can lead to incorrect vertex calculations.\n\n3. **Substitution:** After finding the x-coordinate of the vertex, substitute this value back into the original equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate.\n\n4. **Parabola Orientation:** Determine whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards by checking the sign of \\(a\\). If \\(a > 0\\), the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex represents the minimum value. If \\(a < 0\\), the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex represents the maximum value.\n\n5. **Graphical Check:** Optionally, visualize or sketch the graph of the quadratic function to confirm the vertex and the direction of the parabola.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the least possible value of a quadratic function."}
