{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Equation of a Circle:** Recall the standard form of the equation of a circle, which is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n2. **Intersection of Circles:** When finding the intersection points of two circles, set the equations of the circles equal to each other after expanding them. This will help you find the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n3. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to understand the geometric relationship between the centers of the circles and the points of intersection. The distance between the centers is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n4. **System of Equations:** Solve the system of equations formed by the circle equations to find the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). This often involves substitution or elimination methods.\n\n5. **Pythagorean Theorem:** When dealing with right triangles formed by the centers of the circles and the points of intersection, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the segments.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to algebraic manipulations and calculations, as errors in these steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\n7. **Verification:** After finding the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), calculate \\((AB)^2\\) and verify that it matches the given conditions of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
