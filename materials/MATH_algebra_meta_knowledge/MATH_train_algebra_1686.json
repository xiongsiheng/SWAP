{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponent Rules:** Recall the rules of exponents, particularly how to handle fractional exponents. For example, \\(a^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\) means the nth root of \\(a^m\\).\n\n2. **Combining Exponents:** When dividing expressions with the same base, subtract the exponents. For example, \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractional Exponents:** Simplify the fractional exponents by finding a common denominator and performing the arithmetic carefully.\n\n4. **Consistency in Base and Exponent:** Ensure that when you combine or simplify exponents, the base remains consistent throughout the calculation.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After simplifying, double-check your calculations to ensure that the arithmetic operations with exponents are correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving fractional exponents and roots."}
