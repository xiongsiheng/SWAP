{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recognize that an arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms. In this case, the difference between the number of cans in each layer is -3 (since each subsequent layer has 3 fewer cans).\n\n2. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \\), where \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the series, \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and \\( a_n \\) is the last term.\n\n3. **Finding the Number of Terms:** Determine the number of layers (terms) in the sequence by recognizing that the sequence starts at 28 and ends at 1, decreasing by 3 each time. This can be found by solving \\( 28 + (n-1)(-3) = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Be cautious with signs and calculations, especially when dealing with negative differences or when calculating the number of terms.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations for the number of terms and the sum of the series to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
