{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) must be greater than zero. In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = m\\), and \\(c = 4\\), so \\(\\Delta = m^2 - 16 > 0\\).\n\n2. **Solving Inequalities:** When solving the inequality \\(m^2 - 16 > 0\\), factorize the quadratic expression to \\( (m - 4)(m + 4) > 0 \\). Determine the intervals where the product of two factors is positive by considering the sign changes at the roots.\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** Express the solution in interval notation correctly. For \\( (m - 4)(m + 4) > 0 \\), the solution is \\( m < -4 \\) or \\( m > 4 \\), which in interval notation is \\( (-\\infty, -4) \\cup (4, \\infty) \\).\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Ensure that you do not include the boundary points \\(m = -4\\) and \\(m = 4\\) in the solution set, as these would result in a single root (not distinct roots).\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Verify that your intervals correctly represent the condition for two distinct real roots by testing values within each interval in the original quadratic expression.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
