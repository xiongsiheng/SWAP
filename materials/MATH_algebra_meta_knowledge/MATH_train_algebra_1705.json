{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recognize that the equation \\( y = |x^2 - 6x + 5| \\) involves an absolute value, which means the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 \\) can be either positive or negative. This affects the shape and intersections of the graph.\n\n2. **Solving Systems of Equations:** When solving a system of equations graphically, find the points where the graphs of the two equations intersect. These points are the solutions to the system.\n\n3. **Factoring Quadratics:** For the quadratic \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 \\), factor it to understand its roots and the behavior of the absolute value function. Factoring \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 \\) gives \\( (x-1)(x-5) \\), indicating roots at \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Intersection Points:** Calculate the intersection points by setting the equations equal to each other: \\( |x^2 - 6x + 5| = \frac{29}{4} - x \\). Consider both cases where the quadratic is positive and negative.\n\n5. **Sum of Coordinates:** After finding the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the intersection points, sum them directly. This step is straightforward but requires accurate calculation of each intersection point.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations for each intersection point and the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
