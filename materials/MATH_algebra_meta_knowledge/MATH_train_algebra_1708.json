{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving logarithms, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Equations:** Know the definition of a logarithm, which states that if \\(\\log_b a = c\\), then \\(b^c = a\\). This helps in converting logarithmic equations into exponential form.\n\n2. **Properties of Logarithms:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as the product rule (\\(\\log_b (mn) = \\log_b m + \\log_b n\\)), the quotient rule (\\(\\log_b \\left(\frac{m}{n}\right) = \\log_b m - \\log_b n\\)), and the power rule (\\(\\log_b (m^n) = n \\log_b m\\)). These properties are crucial for simplifying expressions.\n\n3. **Base Conversion:** Understand how to convert logarithms from one base to another using the change of base formula: \\(\\log_b a = \frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b}\\). This is particularly useful when dealing with logarithms of different bases.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and roots, as these operations can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the value of \\(x\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify its correctness. Additionally, when finding \\(\\log_x 27\\), ensure that the final answer is in its simplest fractional form.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving logarithms."}
