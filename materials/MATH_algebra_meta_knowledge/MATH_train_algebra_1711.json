{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Each Equation:** Start by simplifying each equation by combining like terms. This will make the equations easier to work with and reduce the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\n2. **Isolating Variables:** Try to isolate one variable in terms of the other. This can be done by rearranging the equations to solve for one variable, which can then be substituted into the other equation.\n\n3. **Substitution Method:** Use the substitution method to solve for one variable and then find the other. Substitute the expression for one variable from one equation into the other equation.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), substitute them back into both original equations to ensure they satisfy both equations. This step is crucial to verify that the solution is correct and not the result of an algebraic mistake.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and operations, especially when dealing with negative signs and subtraction, as these are common sources of error.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
