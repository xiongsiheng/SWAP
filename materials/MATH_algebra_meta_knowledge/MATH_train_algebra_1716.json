{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Combining Fractions:** When dealing with fractions that have a common denominator, combine them by adding or subtracting the numerators while keeping the denominator the same.\n\n2. **Isolating Variables:** After combining fractions, isolate the variable by performing operations that balance both sides of the equation. For example, if you multiply both sides by a term, ensure it is done correctly to maintain equality.\n\n3. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving for the variable, check if the solution makes any denominator zero, as this would result in an undefined expression. Such solutions are extraneous and should be discarded.\n\n4. **Substitution Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
