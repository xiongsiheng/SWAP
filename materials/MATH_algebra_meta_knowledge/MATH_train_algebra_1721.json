{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of quadratic equation and finding the sum of specific expressions involving its roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots of the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the equation.\n\n2. **Discriminant Check:** Before solving, check the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to ensure the equation has real solutions. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\n3. **Roots Properties:** Recall that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(a + b\\) is \\(-b/a\\) and the product of the roots \\(ab\\) is \\(c/a\\). These properties can help verify your solutions.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic, especially when calculating square roots and dividing. Small errors can significantly impact the final result.\n\n5. **Solution Verification:** After finding the roots \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), substitute them back into the original equation to confirm they are correct. Then, calculate \\(2a + b\\) carefully to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points will help minimize mistakes and ensure accurate solutions for quadratic equations and related calculations."}
