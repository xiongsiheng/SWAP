{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying and expressing the given expression in the form of \\(\\sqrt{N}\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Radicals:** Use the property \\(\\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\) to break down each radical into its simplest form. For example, \\(\\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt{9 \\cdot 5} = 3\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After simplifying each term, combine like terms under a single radical. Ensure that you are adding or subtracting the coefficients of the same radicals.\n\n3. **Division of Radicals:** When dividing radicals, use the property \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}\\). This simplifies the division of radicals into a single radical.\n\n4. **Checking for Perfect Squares:** After combining all terms under a single radical, check if the resulting expression is a perfect square. This will confirm that \\(N\\) is an integer.\n\n5. **Double-Check Simplifications:** Always double-check your simplifications to ensure that each step was performed correctly, as errors in simplification can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
