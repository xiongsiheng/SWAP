{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Before substituting the value of \\( x \\), try to factorize the numerator if possible. This can simplify the expression and make the substitution easier.\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting \\( x = 2 \\), ensure that you substitute correctly into both the numerator and the denominator. Misplacing a negative sign or a number can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Simplification:** After substitution, simplify the expression step by step. Pay close attention to operations involving fractions and negative signs.\n\n4. **Checking for Undefined Values:** Ensure that the denominator does not become zero when substituting \\( x = 2 \\). If it does, the expression is undefined at that point.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After simplifying, double-check your final answer by substituting \\( x = 2 \\) back into the simplified expression to ensure consistency.\n\nThese steps should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
