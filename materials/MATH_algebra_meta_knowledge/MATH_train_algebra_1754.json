{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perfect Squares:** Recognize that a quadratic expression \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is a perfect square if it can be written as \\( (dx + e)^2 \\). This implies that the quadratic must have identical roots, and the quadratic formula simplifies to a single root.\n\n2. **Form of a Perfect Square:** For a quadratic to be a perfect square, it must be of the form \\( (px + q)^2 = p^2x^2 + 2pqx + q^2 \\). Compare the coefficients of \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x \\) to find \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching:** When matching coefficients, ensure that the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) in the original quadratic matches \\( p^2 \\) and the coefficient of \\( x \\) matches \\( 2pq \\). This will help you determine \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) correctly.\n\n4. **Calculating the Constant Term:** Once \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are determined, calculate the constant term \\( q^2 \\) to find \\( a \\). This step is crucial as it directly gives the value of the constant term in the original quadratic.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( a \\), verify that \\( 4x^2 - 12x + a \\) can indeed be written as a perfect square by expanding \\( (2x - 3)^2 \\) and checking that it matches the original quadratic.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
