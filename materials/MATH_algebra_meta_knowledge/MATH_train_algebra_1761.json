{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Always follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means performing operations in parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n2. **Simplify Numerator and Denominator Separately:** Simplify the numerator and the denominator separately before dividing. This helps in avoiding mistakes that can occur when trying to simplify the entire fraction at once.\n\n3. **Check for Common Factors:** Look for common factors in the numerator and the denominator that can be canceled out before performing the division. This simplifies the calculation and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding or subtracting large numbers, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** After obtaining a result, it can be helpful to estimate the answer or use a calculator to double-check the computation, ensuring that the final result is accurate.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
