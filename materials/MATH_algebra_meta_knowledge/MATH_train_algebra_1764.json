{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Unit Conversion:** Ensure that all measurements are in the same units. For example, convert inches to feet or vice versa as needed.\n\n2. **Area Calculation:** Remember that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one side. If the area is given, you can find the side length by taking the square root of the area.\n\n3. **Tile Dimensions:** When calculating how many tiles fit in a row, consider the dimensions of the tiles and the length of the room's side.\n\n4. **Precision in Calculations:** Use precise calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and division, to avoid rounding errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always verify your calculations by checking if the number of tiles per row multiplied by the number of rows matches the total number of tiles needed to cover the floor.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
