{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** Recall that if a point \\((a, b)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\), then the point \\((b, a)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = f^{-1}(x)\\). This is because the inverse function \\(f^{-1}\\) reverses the coordinates of any point on the graph of \\(f\\).\n\n2. **Scaling Functions:** If a point \\((x, y)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = \frac{f(x)}{2}\\), then the y-coordinate is halved compared to the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\). Similarly, for the inverse function, if a point \\((x, y)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = \frac{f^{-1}(x)}{2}\\), the y-coordinate is also halved.\n\n3. **Coordinate Transformations:** When transforming points between graphs of functions and their inverses, ensure that you correctly apply any scaling factors to both coordinates.\n\n4. **Sum of Coordinates:** To find the sum of the coordinates of a point, simply add the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate together. This step should be straightforward if the previous steps are correctly executed.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by ensuring that the transformed point indeed satisfies the equation of the graph it is supposed to be on. This step will help catch any errors in coordinate transformation or scaling.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
