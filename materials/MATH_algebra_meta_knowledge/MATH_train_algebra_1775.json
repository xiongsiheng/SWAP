{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Division and Fractions:** Remember that division can be expressed as a fraction. For example, \\(a \\div b = \frac{a}{b}\\).\n\n2. **Chain of Divisions:** When dealing with a chain of divisions, express each division as a fraction and then manipulate these fractions to find the desired ratio.\n\n3. **Cross-Multiplication and Simplification:** Use cross-multiplication and simplification techniques to manipulate fractions. For example, if \\(\frac{a}{b} = 2\\), then \\(a = 2b\\).\n\n4. **Substitution:** Substitute known values into the equations to find the unknown. For example, if \\(a = 2b\\) and \\(b = \frac{3}{4}c\\), substitute \\(b\\) into the equation for \\(a\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when dealing with fractions and their manipulations, as these can be prone to errors.\n\n6. **Final Verification:** Once you have your final answer, verify it by substituting it back into the original relationships to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
