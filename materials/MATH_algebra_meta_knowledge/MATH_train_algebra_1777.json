{"Knowledge": "To determine how many numbers in the given list are integers, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Understanding Roots:** Recognize that the nth root of a number x, denoted as \\(\\sqrt[n]{x}\\), is an integer if and only if x is a perfect nth power. For example, \\(\\sqrt[3]{27}\\) is an integer because 27 is a perfect cube (\\(3^3\\)).\n\n2. **Identifying Perfect Powers:** To identify if a number is a perfect nth power, you need to find if there exists an integer k such that \\(k^n = x\\). For instance, 4096 is \\(2^{12}\\), so it is a perfect 12th power.\n\n3. **Checking Each Root:** For each nth root in the sequence, check if 4096 is a perfect nth power. This involves determining if there is an integer k such that \\(k^n = 4096\\).\n\n4. **Counting Integers:** Keep a count of how many nth roots of 4096 are integers. This will give you the total number of integers in the list.\n\n5. **Pattern Recognition:** Notice patterns in the powers of 2, as 4096 is \\(2^{12}\\). This can help quickly identify which roots will yield integers.\n\nBy applying these points, you can systematically determine which roots of 4096 are integers and count them accurately."}
