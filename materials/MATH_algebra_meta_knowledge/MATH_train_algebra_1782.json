{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Piecewise Functions:** Ensure you fully understand how piecewise functions work, including how to evaluate them at different values of \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Function Composition:** When dealing with the condition \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), break down the composition into cases based on the definition of \\( f \\). For example, consider \\( x < 2 \\) and \\( x \\ge 2 \\) separately.\n\n3. **Consistency Across Pieces:** Ensure that the function \\( f \\) is consistent across its pieces. This means checking that the values of \\( f \\) for \\( x < 2 \\) and \\( x \\ge 2 \\) match appropriately when substituted into each other.\n\n4. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When you derive equations from the condition \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), solve them simultaneously to find the constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). This step requires careful algebraic manipulation.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), verify that \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) holds for all \\( x \\) to ensure your solution is correct. This step will catch any inconsistencies or mistakes in your calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
