{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Functions:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). Understanding how this function behaves is crucial, especially when dealing with expressions involving division and squares.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify the given equation by considering different cases for \\(n\\), such as even and odd values, since the behavior of the floor function can change based on the parity of \\(n\\).\n\n3. **Checking Parity:** Analyze the equation separately for even and odd values of \\(n\\). This can help in simplifying the expressions and making the problem more manageable.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic, especially when dealing with squares and divisions. Small errors in calculations can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding potential values of \\(n\\), verify each solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
