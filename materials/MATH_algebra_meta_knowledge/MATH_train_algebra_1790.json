{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** Understand the function definition clearly. In this case, \\( E(a,b,c) = a \\cdot b^2 + c \\). Ensure you correctly interpret how the variables \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are used in the function.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values into the function, do so accurately. For example, when substituting \\( b = 4 \\) and \\( c = 5 \\) into \\( E(a,4,5) \\), you should get \\( a \\cdot 4^2 + 5 \\).\n\n3. **Equating Expressions:** Set the two expressions equal to each other correctly. For instance, \\( E(a,4,5) = E(a,6,7) \\) translates to \\( a \\cdot 4^2 + 5 = a \\cdot 6^2 + 7 \\).\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the equation step by step, ensuring each step is logically correct. Pay attention to operations like squaring, multiplication, and addition.\n\n5. **Solving for \\( a \\):** Isolate \\( a \\) on one side of the equation. This might involve subtracting terms, dividing by coefficients of \\( a \\), or other algebraic manipulations.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you find a value for \\( a \\), substitute it back into the original function definitions to verify that both sides of the equation yield the same result. This step helps confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
