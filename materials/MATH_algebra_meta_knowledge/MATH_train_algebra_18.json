{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that when substituting values into the equation, you do so accurately. This includes correctly handling complex numbers if they are part of the variables.\n\n2. **Complex Number Operations:** If complex numbers are involved, be sure to perform operations correctly. For example, adding or subtracting complex numbers involves combining the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\n3. **Simplification Techniques:** When simplifying expressions, especially those involving complex numbers, use proper algebraic techniques. For instance, remember that \\(i^2 = -1\\).\n\n4. **Verification of Solution:** After finding the value of \\(p\\), substitute it back into the original equation along with the given values of \\(f\\) and \\(w\\) to verify that the equation holds True.\n\n5. **Attention to Units:** If the problem involves units, ensure that all calculations maintain consistent units throughout the solution process.\n\nThese guidelines will help minimize errors and ensure accuracy in solving the problem."}
