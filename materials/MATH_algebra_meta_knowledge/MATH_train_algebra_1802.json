{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation involving absolute values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. The expression $|x-7|$ represents the distance of $x$ from 7 on the number line, which is always non-negative.\n\n2. **Solving Absolute Value Equations:** When solving equations involving absolute values, consider the two cases: the expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative. For example, for $|x-7| = y$, you would solve for $x$ in the cases where $x-7 = y$ and $x-7 = -y$.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After solving for $x$, always verify that the solutions satisfy the original equation. This step is crucial as it helps in identifying any extraneous solutions that might have been introduced during the solving process.\n\n4. **Calculating the Product:** When finding the product of all possible values of $x$, ensure that you multiply all valid solutions together correctly. This step requires careful multiplication to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Simplification:** Simplify the equation as much as possible before solving. In this case, simplifying $|x-7| - 3 = -2$ to $|x-7| = 1$ can make the solving process more straightforward.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving equations involving absolute values."}
