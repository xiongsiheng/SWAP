{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the shortest distance between two circles, consider the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Circle Equation:** Convert the given equations of the circles into the standard form \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\) by completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms.\n\n2. **Center and Radius:** Identify the center \\((h, k)\\) and radius \\(r\\) of each circle from the standard form equation.\n\n3. **Distance Between Centers:** Calculate the distance between the centers of the two circles using the distance formula: \\(\\sqrt{(h_2 - h_1)^2 + (k_2 - k_1)^2}\\).\n\n4. **Shortest Distance Calculation:** The shortest distance between two circles that do not intersect is the distance between their centers minus the sum of their radii. If the circles intersect or touch, the shortest distance is zero.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and decimal values, to avoid rounding errors.\n\n6. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, sketch the circles on a coordinate plane to visually confirm the relative positions and verify the calculated distance.\n\nThese guidelines will help minimize errors in determining the shortest distance between two circles."}
