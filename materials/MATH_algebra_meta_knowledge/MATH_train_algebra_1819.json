{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Reciprocals:** Recall that the reciprocal of a number \\( x \\) is \\( \frac{1}{x} \\). For integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), the reciprocal sum equation given is \\( \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n2. **Common Denominator:** To combine the fractions on the left side, find a common denominator: \\( \frac{m + n}{mn} = \frac{1}{4} \\). This implies \\( 4(m + n) = mn \\).\n\n3. **Rewriting Equations:** Rearrange the equation to standard form, such as \\( mn - 4m - 4n = 0 \\). This can be solved using techniques like factoring or the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Symmetry and Pairing:** Notice that \\( (m, n) \\) and \\( (n, m) \\) are considered the same pair due to the commutative property of addition. This symmetry helps in counting distinct pairs correctly.\n\n5. **Checking Bounds:** Ensure that both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers. This constraint helps in limiting the solutions to valid pairs.\n\n6. **Systematic Search:** If direct algebraic manipulation is complex, consider a systematic search for pairs \\( (m, n) \\) within reasonable bounds, checking each candidate pair against the original equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
