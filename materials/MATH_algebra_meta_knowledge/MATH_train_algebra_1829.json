{"Knowledge": "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \\), consider the following points:\n\n1. **Domain Considerations:** The function \\( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \\) is defined for all real numbers \\( x \\) except \\( x = 0 \\), because division by zero is undefined.\n\n2. **Behavior of the Function:** As \\( x \\) approaches 0 from either the positive or negative side, \\( x^2 \\) approaches 0, making \\( \frac{1}{x^2} \\) approach infinity. Conversely, as \\( x \\) moves away from 0 (either positively or negatively), \\( x^2 \\) increases, making \\( \frac{1}{x^2} \\) decrease towards 0.\n\n3. **Non-Negativity of \\( x^2 \\):** Since \\( x^2 \\) is always non-negative for any real number \\( x \\), \\( \frac{1}{x^2} \\) will always be positive.\n\n4. **Range Definition:** The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. For \\( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \\), the output values are all positive real numbers.\n\n5. **Graphical Insight:** Plotting the function can help visualize the range. The graph of \\( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \\) is a hyperbola that approaches infinity as \\( x \\) approaches 0 and approaches 0 as \\( x \\) moves away from 0.\n\nBy considering these points, you can conclude that the range of \\( f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \\) is all positive real numbers, i.e., \\( (0, \\infty) \\)."}
