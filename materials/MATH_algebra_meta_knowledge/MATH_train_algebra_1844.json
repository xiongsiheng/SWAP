{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have rational roots, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be a perfect square. In this case, \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 5\\), and \\(c = b\\), so the discriminant is \\(5^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot b = 25 - 8b\\).\n\n2. **Perfect Square Requirement:** Ensure that \\(25 - 8b\\) is a perfect square. This means you need to find values of \\(b\\) such that \\(25 - 8b = k^2\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Integer Solutions:** Check for integer values of \\(b\\) that satisfy the perfect square condition. This involves testing possible values of \\(k\\) and solving for \\(b\\).\n\n4. **Sum of Values:** Once you find the valid integer values of \\(b\\), sum them up to get the final answer. Ensure you include all possible values within the given constraints.\n\n5. **Range of \\(b\\):** Since \\(b\\) must be a positive integer and \\(25 - 8b \\geq 0\\), \\(b\\) must be less than or equal to \\(\frac{25}{8} = 3.125\\), so \\(b\\) can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
