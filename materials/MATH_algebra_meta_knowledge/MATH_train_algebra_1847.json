{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying polynomial expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distribute the Minus Sign:** When subtracting polynomials, distribute the minus sign to each term in the polynomial being subtracted. This means changing the sign of each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** After distributing the minus sign, combine like terms. This involves adding or subtracting coefficients of terms with the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n3. **Arrange Terms by Degree:** It's often helpful to arrange the terms in descending order by degree (highest power first) to ensure all like terms are combined.\n\n4. **Check for Simplification:** After combining like terms, check if any further simplification is possible, such as factoring or simplifying fractions.\n\n5. **Double-Check Your Work:** Always review your work to ensure that you have correctly distributed the minus sign and combined all like terms accurately.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in simplifying polynomial expressions."}
