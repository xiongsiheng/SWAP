{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Sequential Operations:** Understand that the operations in the function machine are performed sequentially. Start with the initial input and apply each operation in the order they appear.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform each arithmetic operation accurately. This includes multiplication, addition, and subtraction, as each step depends on the correct result of the previous step.\n\n3. **Comparison Step:** Pay close attention to the comparison step. Depending on whether the result is less than or greater than 18, different subsequent operations are applied. This decision point is crucial and should be evaluated correctly.\n\n4. **Checking Intermediate Results:** It can be helpful to keep track of intermediate results after each operation to ensure that each step is performed correctly before moving on to the next.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the final output, consider verifying the result by performing the operations in reverse order or by using a different method to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems involving sequential operations and conditional logic."}
