{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Use the algebraic identities for squares of sums and differences. Specifically, remember that \\((x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\\) and \\((x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2\\).\n\n2. **Relating Expressions:** Understand how to relate \\((x + y)^2\\) and \\((x - y)^2\\) using the given information. Since both expressions involve \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\), you can use the given \\(xy\\) value to find the difference.\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute the given values into the identities and simplify carefully. Ensure that you correctly handle the terms involving \\(xy\\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to avoid common errors, especially when dealing with squared terms and products.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking if the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy the original equations also satisfy the derived equation for \\((x - y)^2\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
