{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognizing Patterns:** Identify if the sequence follows a specific pattern, such as a geometric series, which can simplify the calculation.\n\n2. **Common Denominator:** When adding or subtracting fractions, find a common denominator to combine them into a single fraction.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** After combining fractions, simplify the resulting fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check each step of your calculations, especially when dealing with multiple fractions and their denominators.\n\n5. **Using Formulas:** If the sequence is a geometric series, use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series (if applicable), which is \\(S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
