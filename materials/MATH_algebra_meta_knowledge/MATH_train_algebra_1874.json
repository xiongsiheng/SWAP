{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents:** Recall the properties of exponents, particularly that \\(2^a \\cdot 2^b = 2^{a+b}\\) and \\(\\frac{2^a}{2^b} = 2^{a-b}\\).\n\n2. **Fractional Operations:** When dealing with fractions of powers, simplify the fraction first. For example, \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2^{30} = 2^{-2} \\cdot 2^{30} = 2^{30-2}\\).\n\n3. **Consistency in Operations:** Ensure that you consistently apply the rules of exponents throughout the problem to avoid mixing up different operations.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when subtracting exponents, to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have your answer, verify it by substituting \\(x\\) back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
