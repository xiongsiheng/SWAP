{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** The sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers can be calculated using the formula \\( S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). For Jo's sum, \\( n = 50 \\).\n\n2. **Rounding Rules:** Understand the rounding rules clearly. In this case, numbers ending in 1 through 4 are rounded down, and numbers ending in 5 through 9 are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** Identify the pattern in how numbers are rounded. For example, numbers 1-4 round to 0, 5-14 round to 10, 15-24 round to 20, and so on up to 45-50 rounding to 50.\n\n4. **Calculating Rounded Sums:** Calculate the sum of the rounded values by recognizing the repeating pattern in the rounded numbers. For instance, each set of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes a specific sum after rounding.\n\n5. **Difference Calculation:** Subtract Kate's sum from Jo's sum carefully to find the positive difference. Ensure that the subtraction is done accurately to avoid sign errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
