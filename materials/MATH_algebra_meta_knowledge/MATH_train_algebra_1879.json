{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the number of grains on each square doubles from the previous square, which is an example of exponential growth. This means the number of grains on the \\(k\\)-th square is \\(2^k\\).\n\n2. **Sum of a Geometric Series:** When calculating the total number of grains on the first \\(n\\) squares, you are dealing with the sum of a geometric series. The sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of a geometric series where the first term is \\(a\\) and the common ratio is \\(r\\) is given by \\(S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\). In this case, \\(a = 2^1\\) and \\(r = 2\\).\n\n3. **Correct Calculation of Powers:** Ensure that you correctly calculate powers of 2. For example, \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) and \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n\n4. **Subtraction Accuracy:** When subtracting the total grains of the first 8 squares from the grains on the 10th square, perform the subtraction carefully to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers and powers of 2, to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
