{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of a segment, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Use the midpoint formula, which is given by \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the endpoints.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that you correctly add the corresponding coordinates of the endpoints and then divide by 2. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Sum of Coordinates:** After finding the midpoint, add the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate to get the sum. This step should be straightforward if the previous steps are done correctly.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially for the addition and division steps, to avoid common mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
