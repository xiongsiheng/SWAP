{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving exponents, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Exponent Rules:** Apply the correct exponent rules. For example, when multiplying powers with the same base, add the exponents: \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Substitute the given value for the variable accurately. Ensure that you replace every instance of the variable with the given value.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform arithmetic operations carefully, especially when dealing with exponents, as these calculations can be prone to errors if not done meticulously.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each step is logically correct and follows the rules of algebra.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After finding the final answer, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, as this step can catch any inadvertent mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
