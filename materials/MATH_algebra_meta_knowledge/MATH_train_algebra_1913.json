{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Remember that when two quantities are inversely proportional, their product is constant. In this case, the product of pressure (P) and volume (V) remains constant: \\( P_1 \times V_1 = P_2 \times V_2 \\).\n\n2. **Using Correct Units:** Ensure that all measurements are in consistent units. Here, both volumes are in liters and pressures in kilopascals, so no conversion is needed.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the relationship \\( P_1 \times V_1 = P_2 \times V_2 \\) to set up your equation correctly, substituting the given values for \\( P_1 \\), \\( V_1 \\), and \\( V_2 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating Accurately:** Perform the arithmetic carefully to avoid calculation errors. Multiply and divide accurately to find the new pressure.\n\n5. **Checking the Result:** Verify that the new pressure makes sense in the context of the problem. Since the volume has increased, the pressure should decrease, which is consistent with the inverse proportionality.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
