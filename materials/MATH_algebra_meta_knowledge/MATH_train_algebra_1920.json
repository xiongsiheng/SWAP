{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Time Conversion:** Ensure you correctly convert the given time into a consistent unit. For example, convert hours to minutes or vice versa, depending on the problem's requirements.\n\n2. **Rate of Consumption:** Understand the rate at which the action (eating a Popsicle) occurs. In this case, Megan eats a Popsicle every 15 minutes.\n\n3. **Calculation of Total Time:** Calculate the total time in the appropriate unit (minutes in this case) by adding the hours and minutes together and then converting the hours to minutes.\n\n4. **Division for Total Consumption:** Divide the total time by the rate of consumption to find the total number of Popsicles consumed. Ensure you perform this division accurately to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your arithmetic to ensure that the calculations are correct, as simple arithmetic mistakes can lead to incorrect answers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
