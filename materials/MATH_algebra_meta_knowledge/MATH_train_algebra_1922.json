{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the coefficient of \\( x \\) in this type of expression, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly by multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside. For example, \\( 3(x - 4) \\) becomes \\( 3x - 12 \\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms carefully. Terms involving \\( x \\) should be grouped together, and constants should be grouped separately.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure accurate arithmetic operations when multiplying and adding terms. Small arithmetic errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure that operations are performed in the correct sequence. This is crucial when dealing with multiple operations.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After simplifying the expression, double-check the coefficient of \\( x \\) by ensuring all terms involving \\( x \\) have been correctly combined. This step helps verify the accuracy of your simplification.\n\nThese guidelines will help minimize errors and ensure accurate determination of the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the given expression."}
