{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Use algebraic identities to simplify expressions. For example, recall that \\(p^2 + q^2 = (p + q)^2 - 2pq\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Substitute the given values into the identity to simplify the expression. In this case, substitute \\(p + q = 6\\) and \\(pq = 9\\) into the identity.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when squaring numbers and multiplying them.\n\n4. **Verification:** After calculating the value of \\(p^2 + q^2\\), verify the result by checking if it satisfies the original conditions (if possible).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
