{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Functional Equations:** Recognize that the condition \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) implies that \\( f \\) is an involution, meaning \\( f \\) is its own inverse. This property is crucial for setting up and solving the equation.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Substitute \\( f(x) \\) into itself to form the equation \\( f(f(x)) = x \\). This involves substituting \\( \frac{ax+b}{cx+d} \\) into the function \\( f \\), leading to a more complex rational expression.\n\n3. **Simplifying Rational Expressions:** When dealing with rational functions, ensure that you correctly handle the algebra of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing rational expressions. This includes finding common denominators and simplifying numerators.\n\n4. **Identifying Coefficients:** After setting up the equation, compare the coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant terms on both sides of the equation. This comparison should yield a system of equations involving \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\).\n\n5. **Solving the System of Equations:** Solve the system of equations to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( d \\). Be meticulous in solving these equations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you have determined the values of \\( a \\) and \\( d \\), verify that these values satisfy the original condition \\( f(f(x)) = x \\). This step ensures that your solution is correct and that no mistakes were made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
