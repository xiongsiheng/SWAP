{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Inverses:** Understand how to find the inverse of a function. For a function \\( f(x) = \frac{3}{2-x} \\), the inverse \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) can be found by swapping \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the equation and solving for \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with fractions and solving for variables. Ensure that you correctly isolate variables and simplify expressions.\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions or their inverses, double-check that you are substituting the correct values and that your calculations are accurate.\n\n4. **Function Evaluation:** Ensure you correctly evaluate functions at given points. For example, when finding \\( g(3) \\), you need to first determine \\( f^{-1}(3) \\) and then use that result in the expression for \\( g(x) \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( g(3) \\), it can be useful to verify your steps by checking if the function and inverse relationships hold True. This can help catch any errors in the process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
