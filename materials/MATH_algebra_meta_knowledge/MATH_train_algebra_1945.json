{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages:** Remember that a percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. For example, 80% means 80 out of 100.\n\n2. **Calculating Required Score:** To find out how many problems you need to solve correctly to pass, multiply the total number of problems by the required percentage (as a decimal). For instance, if you need 80%, you would calculate 0.80 times the total number of problems.\n\n3. **Determining Missable Problems:** Subtract the number of problems you need to solve correctly from the total number of problems to find out the maximum number of problems you can miss.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you perform the multiplication and subtraction accurately to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Re-calculate the required number of correct problems and the maximum missable problems to confirm your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
