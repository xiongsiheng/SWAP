{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Piecewise Functions:** Ensure you correctly interpret and apply the conditions for each piece of the piecewise function. Identify which part of the function applies based on the input value.\n\n2. **Nested Functions:** When dealing with nested functions, evaluate the inner function first. Determine the output of the inner function and then use that result as the input for the outer function.\n\n3. **Checking All Cases:** For each piece of the outer function, consider all possible pieces of the inner function that could apply. This ensures you do not miss any potential solutions.\n\n4. **Solving Equations:** Solve the resulting equations carefully, ensuring you isolate variables correctly and check for extraneous solutions.\n\n5. **Counting Solutions:** After solving for each case, count all distinct solutions. Ensure that solutions are valid within the context of the original piecewise function's conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
