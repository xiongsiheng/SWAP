{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating Equations:** Set up the equations correctly based on the given conditions. For this problem, let the two integers be \\( x \\) and \\( x + 6 \\). Their product is given as 135, so the equation becomes \\( x(x + 6) = 135 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When solving the resulting quadratic equation \\( x^2 + 6x - 135 = 0 \\), use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) or factorize if possible. Ensure that the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) is non-negative.\n\n3. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Verify that the solutions are positive integers, as specified in the problem. Discard any non-integer or negative solutions.\n\n4. **Identifying the Larger Integer:** Once you have the correct integer solutions, identify which one is larger by comparing their values.\n\n5. **Double-Checking:** Always verify your final answer by checking if the two integers indeed differ by 6 and their product is 135. This step ensures that your solution meets all the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
