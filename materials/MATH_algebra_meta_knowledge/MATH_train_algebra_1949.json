{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Recognize and apply algebraic identities. For this problem, the identity \\(x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)\\) is crucial.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** When given a system of equations, solve them step by step. In this case, you can find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by adding and subtracting the given equations.\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** After finding the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), substitute them into the expression \\(x^2 - y^2\\) and simplify carefully to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with multiplications and subtractions, to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by substituting the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) back into the original equations to confirm they hold True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
