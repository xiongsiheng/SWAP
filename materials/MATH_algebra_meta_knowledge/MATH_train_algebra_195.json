{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Clearing the Fraction:** When you multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to clear the fraction, ensure that you distribute correctly and handle the resulting polynomial equation accurately.\n\n2. **Solving Polynomial Equations:** Use appropriate methods to solve the resulting polynomial equation, such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Be meticulous with signs and coefficients.\n\n3. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, check each solution to ensure it does not make the original denominator zero, as these are extraneous solutions that must be discarded.\n\n4. **Calculating the Difference:** When finding the positive difference between the solutions, ensure you subtract the smaller value from the larger value to get a positive result.\n\n5. **Double-Check Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and polynomials, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
