{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( g(f(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( f \\) to \\( x \\), and then apply \\( g \\) to the result of \\( f(x) \\). Ensure you correctly substitute the inner function \\( f(x) \\) into the outer function \\( g \\).\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values, especially negative numbers, into functions, double-check your arithmetic to avoid common mistakes like incorrect signs or miscalculations.\n\n3. **Simplification Steps:** After substitution, simplify the resulting expression step by step. Ensure each step is logically correct and that you are not skipping any necessary steps.\n\n4. **Final Verification:** Once you have your final answer, verify it by substituting back into the original functions or equations to ensure consistency. This step helps catch any errors that might have occurred during the process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
