{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Properties:** Recognize that the given function property \\( f(3x-1) = x^2 + x + 1 \\) applies for all real numbers \\( x \\). This means you need to find a value of \\( x \\) such that \\( 3x - 1 = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\( x \\):** To find \\( f(5) \\), set up the equation \\( 3x - 1 = 5 \\) and solve for \\( x \\). This step involves basic algebraic manipulation.\n\n3. **Substituting \\( x \\) Back into the Function:** Once you have the value of \\( x \\), substitute it back into the expression \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) to find the value of \\( f(5) \\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you correctly solve for \\( x \\) and substitute it accurately into the function expression to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by checking if the function property holds True for the value of \\( x \\) you found.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
