{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** Remember the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a + l) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a \\) is the first term, and \\( l \\) is the last term.\n\n2. **Identifying Even and Odd Numbers:** Ensure you correctly identify even and odd numbers. Even numbers are divisible by 2, while odd numbers are not.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Terms:** Accurately calculate the number of terms in each series. For even numbers from 2 to 500, the number of terms is \\( \frac{500 - 2}{2} + 1 \\). For numbers from 1 to 250, the number of terms is \\( 250 \\).\n\n4. **Division of Sums:** When dividing the sums, ensure you perform the division accurately. Use the exact sums calculated, not approximations, to avoid rounding errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations for the sums and the division to ensure accuracy. Small errors in summing or dividing can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
