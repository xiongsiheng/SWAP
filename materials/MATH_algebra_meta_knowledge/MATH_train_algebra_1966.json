{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that the number of canoes built each month forms a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Sum:** Use the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series: \\( S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term, \\( r \\) is the common ratio, and \\( n \\) is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Correct Term Calculation:** Ensure you correctly calculate the number of terms in the series for the given period (in this case, from January to March, which is 3 months).\n\n4. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the month-by-month progression to avoid miscalculating the number of canoes built each month.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the application of the geometric series formula to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
