{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Linear Functions:** Recognize that a linear function \\( f(x) \\) can be expressed in the form \\( f(x) = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Inverse Functions:** For a linear function \\( f(x) = mx + b \\), the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is given by \\( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - b}{m} \\). Ensure you correctly derive the inverse function.\n\n3. **Substitution and Solving:** When substituting known values into the function or its inverse, double-check your substitutions to avoid algebraic errors. For example, substituting \\( x = 1 \\) into \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) correctly.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Use the given condition \\( f(1) = 4 \\) to find the specific form of \\( f(x) \\). Ensure that the derived function satisfies this condition.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:** After determining the specific form of \\( f(x) \\), carefully calculate \\( f(2) \\) using the derived function. Verify the calculation step-by-step to prevent arithmetic mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
