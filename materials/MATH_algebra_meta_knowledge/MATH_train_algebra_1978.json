{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving function transformations and periodicity, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Periodicity:** Recognize that a function \\( f(x) \\) is periodic with period \\( p \\) if \\( f(x + p) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\). This means shifting the graph horizontally by \\( p \\) units results in the same graph.\n\n2. **Scaling Arguments:** When transforming the argument of a function, such as \\( f\\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \\), understand that the period of the function changes. If \\( f(x) \\) has a period of \\( p \\), then \\( f\\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \\) has a period of \\( 5p \\).\n\n3. **Relating Shifts to Periods:** For the graph of \\( y = f\\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \\) to be identical after a horizontal shift, the shift must be a multiple of its period. Therefore, find the period of \\( f\\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \\) and determine the smallest positive multiple that satisfies the condition.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that calculations involving scaling and shifting are done accurately, as errors in these steps can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you determine the smallest positive \\( a \\), verify that shifting the graph by \\( a \\) units results in the same graph, confirming the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving function transformations and periodicity."}
