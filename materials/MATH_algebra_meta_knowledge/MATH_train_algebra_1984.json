{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractions:** Ensure you correctly interpret the fractions involved. In this case, understanding what it means for the tank to be $\\frac{7}{8}$ full and then half full is crucial.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations. For instance, if the tank is $\\frac{7}{8}$ full and then becomes half full after using 12 gallons, you can set up an equation based on the amount of gasoline used.\n\n3. **Consistent Units:** Make sure all units are consistent. Here, the units are in gallons, so ensure all quantities are in gallons.\n\n4. **Solving for the Unknown:** Use algebra to solve for the unknown, which in this case is the total capacity of the tank. Ensure you isolate the variable correctly.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your solution by substituting the calculated capacity back into the problem to ensure it satisfies the conditions given. This step helps catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
