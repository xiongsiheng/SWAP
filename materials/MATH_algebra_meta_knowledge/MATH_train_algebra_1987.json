{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection of two lines, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you are dealing with a system of linear equations. The goal is to find values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.\n\n2. **Elimination or Substitution:** Choose a method (elimination or substitution) to solve the system. For elimination, multiply equations to align coefficients for one variable, then add or subtract to eliminate that variable. For substitution, solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other equation.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with fractions or large numbers, as these can introduce calculation errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), substitute them back into both original equations to verify that they satisfy both equations. This step helps confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\n5. **Order of Variables:** When presenting the solution as an ordered pair \\((x, y)\\), ensure that the \\(x\\)-coordinate is listed first and the \\(y\\)-coordinate second, following the standard notation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
