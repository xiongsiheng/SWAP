{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the least value of \\( y \\) in this quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\( y = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = 5 \\), and \\( c = -2 \\). This formula helps find the roots of the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Discriminant Check:** Before applying the quadratic formula, check the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). If it's negative, there are no real solutions. If it's zero, there is exactly one solution. If it's positive, there are two distinct solutions.\n\n3. **Simplifying Roots:** When calculating the roots, simplify the square root and the division steps carefully to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Choosing the Least Value:** After finding the two possible values of \\( y \\), select the one with the least value.\n\n5. **Substitution Check:** Optionally, substitute the calculated values back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it, though this is less critical for finding the least value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
