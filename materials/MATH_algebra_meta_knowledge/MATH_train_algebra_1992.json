{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Clearly define the relationships between the variables based on the given conditions. In this case, you have three conditions that can be translated into equations.\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When you have multiple equations, use algebraic methods to solve for the variables. Ensure that you manipulate the equations correctly, especially when adding or subtracting them.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic calculations, particularly when dealing with operations like multiplication and addition, as these are common sources of error.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the value of \\( N \\), substitute it back into the original conditions to verify that it satisfies all the given relationships.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure that your solution is logically consistent with the problem's constraints. For example, in this problem, \\( N \\) must be a value that fits all three conditions involving \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
