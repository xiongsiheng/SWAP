{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponent Rules:** Recall that for an expression \\(a^b = 1\\) to hold True, \\(a\\) must be 1 or \\(-1\\) if \\(b\\) is an even integer, or \\(b\\) must be 0 regardless of \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Base:** In the equation \\((x-2)^{(25-x^2)} = 1\\), consider the conditions under which the base \\(x-2\\) can be 1 or \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Exponent Evaluation:** Also, consider the exponent \\(25-x^2\\). For the equation to hold, \\(25-x^2\\) must be 0 or an even integer if \\(x-2\\) is \\(-1\\).\n\n4. **Integer Solutions:** Focus on finding integer values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation. This involves checking both the base and the exponent for valid integer solutions.\n\n5. **Systematic Checking:** Systematically check each potential integer solution by substituting back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
