{"Knowledge": "To accurately solve for the sum of the $x$-coordinates where $f(x) = 1.8$ in a graph composed of line segments, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Intersections:** Locate all points on the graph where the function value equals 1.8. This involves identifying where the red line segments cross the horizontal line at $y = 1.8$.\n\n2. **Read Coordinates Accurately:** Ensure you read the $x$-coordinates of these intersection points accurately from the graph. Pay attention to the scale and grid lines, as each grid line represents a unit increment.\n\n3. **Sum Calculation:** After identifying the $x$-coordinates, sum them up. Ensure that you include all relevant points and avoid adding any extraneous coordinates.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your findings by checking the consistency of the intersections with the given function segments. This step helps in ensuring that no intersections are missed or incorrectly identified.\n\nThese steps will help in accurately determining the sum of the $x$-coordinates where $f(x) = 1.8$ on the given graph."}
