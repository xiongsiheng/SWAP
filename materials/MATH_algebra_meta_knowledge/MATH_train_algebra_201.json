{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** When dealing with a system of linear equations, use substitution or elimination methods to find the values of the variables. Ensure that each step is logically consistent and that you are solving for the correct variables.\n\n2. **Checking Consistency:** Verify that the system of equations is consistent and that there is a unique solution. Inconsistent systems or systems with infinitely many solutions can complicate the problem.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing numbers. Small arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Square Root Calculation:** When finding the square root of a product, ensure that the product is calculated correctly before taking the square root. Remember that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, provided all numbers are non-negative.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), substitute them back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy all conditions. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
