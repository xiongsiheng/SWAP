{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that \\(x^2 = 16\\) is a quadratic equation which can be solved by taking the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root of a number yields both a positive and a negative solution.\n\n2. **Square Roots and Solutions:** When solving \\(x^2 = 16\\), the solutions are \\(x = \\sqrt{16}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{16}\\), which simplifies to \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -4\\).\n\n3. **Sum of Solutions:** For quadratic equations of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the solutions can be directly found using the formula \\(-b/a\\). In this case, since the equation is \\(x^2 = 16\\), it can be rewritten as \\(x^2 - 16 = 0\\), indicating \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 0\\), so the sum of the solutions is \\(-0/1 = 0\\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
