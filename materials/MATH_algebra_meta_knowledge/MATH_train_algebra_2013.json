{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:** Understand the principles of partial fraction decomposition, where a rational function is expressed as a sum of simpler fractions. Ensure that the denominators in the decomposition match the factors of the original denominator.\n\n2. **Equating Coefficients:** When you have an equation of the form \\(\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\frac{A}{x-a} + \\frac{B}{x-b}\\), multiply through by the denominator \\(Q(x)\\) to clear the fractions. Then, equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\(x\\) on both sides of the equation.\n\n3. **Substitution Method:** Use specific values of \\(x\\) (typically the roots of the denominator) to create a system of equations that can be solved for the unknown coefficients \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Be cautious with values that might lead to division by zero.\n\n4. **System of Equations:** Solve the resulting system of equations carefully, ensuring that you do not make arithmetic errors. Use methods like substitution or elimination to find the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), substitute them back into the original equation to verify that the decomposition is correct. This step helps catch any errors in the decomposition process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
