{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Always follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means you should first handle the exponentiation before applying the ceiling function.\n\n2. **Exponentiation of Negative Numbers:** When raising a negative fraction to a power, the result will be positive if the exponent is even. For example, \\((- \\frac{5}{3})^2 = \\frac{25}{9}\\).\n\n3. **Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\) returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). For fractions, this means rounding up to the next whole number.\n\n4. **Exact Calculations:** Perform calculations exactly, especially when dealing with fractions and exponents, to avoid rounding errors that could affect the ceiling function.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating, verify the result by ensuring it meets the definition of the ceiling function applied to your exact calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
