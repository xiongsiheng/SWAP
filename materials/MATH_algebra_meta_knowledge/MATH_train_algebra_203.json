{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Symmetric Equations:** Recognize that equations like \\(x + y + xy = 76\\) are symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This symmetry often implies that if \\((x, y)\\) is a solution, then \\((y, x)\\) is also a solution.\n\n2. **Factoring Techniques:** Consider rewriting the equation in a factored form. For instance, \\(x + y + xy = 76\\) can be rewritten as \\((x + 1)(y + 1) = 77\\). This transformation can simplify finding integer solutions.\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers less than 20, list the possible pairs \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy the equation. This systematic approach helps avoid missing any solutions.\n\n4. **Checking Limits:** Ensure that both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are within the specified range (less than 20). This check is crucial to avoid incorrect solutions that might arise from misinterpreting the problem constraints.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to confirm they satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
