{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** Recall that the inverse of a function \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) is \\( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - b}{a} \\). This is crucial for correctly expressing \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Equating:** When given \\( g(x) = f^{-1}(x) - 3 \\), substitute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into the equation and equate it to \\( g(x) \\). This will help in finding the relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Be proficient in solving linear equations to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Ensure that you handle coefficients and constants accurately.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with coefficients and constants, to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), verify by substituting back into the original equations to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
