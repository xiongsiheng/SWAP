{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Complex Number Representation:** Remember that a complex number is represented as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Sum of Complex Numbers:** When adding complex numbers, add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together separately. For example, \\((a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i\\).\n\n3. **Using Given Conditions:** Utilize the given conditions (like \\(b = 3\\) and \\(e = -a - c\\)) directly in your calculations to simplify the expressions and find the unknowns.\n\n4. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts:** When given that the sum of the complex numbers equals a specific value (like \\(2i\\)), separate this into its real and imaginary components. For instance, if the sum is \\(2i\\), then the real part must be 0 and the imaginary part must be 2.\n\n5. **Checking Consistency:** Ensure that your final solution satisfies all the given conditions and the original problem statement. This step helps in catching any logical or arithmetic errors made during the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving complex numbers."}
