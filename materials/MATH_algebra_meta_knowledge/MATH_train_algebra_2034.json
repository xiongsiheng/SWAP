{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Circumference and Distance:** Understand that the distance traveled by a horse on a merry-go-round is directly proportional to the circumference of the circle it traces. The circumference of a circle is given by \\( C = 2\\pi r \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n2. **Proportionality:** Recognize that the number of revolutions is inversely proportional to the radius if the distance traveled is the same. This means that if the radius is smaller, the number of revolutions must be greater to cover the same distance.\n\n3. **Calculating Distance:** Calculate the total distance traveled by the first horse using the formula \\( \text{Distance} = \text{Circumference} \times \text{Number of revolutions} \\).\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the calculated distance to set up an equation for the second horse, ensuring that the total distance traveled remains the same.\n\n5. **Solving for Revolutions:** Solve the equation to find the number of revolutions the second horse must make, ensuring that the arithmetic and calculations are accurate.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the final answer to ensure accuracy, as small errors in calculations can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
