{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that function composition involves applying one function to the result of another. In this case, you need to find \\( h(-1) \\) first, and then use that result as the input for \\( g \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating functions. Start by substituting the input value into the innermost function.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with exponents and coefficients. A small error in calculation can lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** After substituting the input value into the function, simplify the expression step by step. Ensure that each step is logically correct and that you are not skipping any steps.\n\n5. **Double-Check Results:** After obtaining the final result, double-check your calculations to ensure there are no mistakes. This includes verifying the arithmetic operations and the sequence of function applications.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
