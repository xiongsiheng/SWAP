{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating the Equation:** Represent the two consecutive negative integers as \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\). The product of these integers is given by \\( n(n+1) = 2550 \\).\n\n2. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form \\( n^2 + n - 2550 = 0 \\). Solve for \\( n \\) using the quadratic formula \\( n = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -2550 \\).\n\n3. **Checking for Negative Integers:** Ensure that the solutions for \\( n \\) are negative integers, as specified in the problem.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum:** Once you have identified the correct negative integer \\( n \\), calculate the sum of \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\).\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify all arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers or complex expressions, to avoid computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
