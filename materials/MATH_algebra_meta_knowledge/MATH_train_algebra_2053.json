{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the sum of the first five terms in a geometric sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio:** Determine the common ratio (r) of the sequence by dividing any term by the previous term. In this case, the common ratio is \\(\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Use the Sum Formula:** The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula \\(S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Correct Exponentiation:** Ensure that you correctly compute \\(r^n\\) for the given number of terms. For this problem, you need to calculate \\((\frac{1}{3})^5\\).\n\n4. **Simplify Carefully:** When simplifying the expression \\(\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\), be meticulous with fractions and ensure that all operations are performed correctly.\n\n5. **Check the Final Answer:** After obtaining the sum, verify that the answer is a common fraction and that it makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
