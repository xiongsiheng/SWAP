{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Variation:** Recall that if \\( y^3 \\) varies inversely with \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\), then \\( y^3 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{z} = k \\) for some constant \\( k \\). This relationship is crucial for setting up the equation.\n\n2. **Finding the Constant \\( k \\):** Use the given values of \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) to determine the constant \\( k \\). For example, if \\( y = 2 \\) when \\( z = 1 \\), substitute these values into the equation to find \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Substituting New Values:** Once \\( k \\) is determined, use the new value of \\( y \\) to find the corresponding value of \\( z \\). Substitute \\( y = 4 \\) into the equation and solve for \\( z \\).\n\n4. **Simplifying Fractions:** Ensure that the final answer for \\( z \\) is expressed in simplest fractional form. This involves reducing the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify your calculations step-by-step to avoid arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with exponents and roots.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
