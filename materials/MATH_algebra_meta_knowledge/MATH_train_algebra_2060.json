{"Knowledge": "To determine the number of zeros in the expansion of a large number squared, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure of the Number:** Analyze the given number and its properties. For instance, \\(999,999,999,998\\) is very close to \\(1,000,000,000,000\\).\n\n2. **Using Algebraic Manipulation:** You can use algebraic identities like \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) to simplify calculations. Here, \\(a = 1,000,000,000,000\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n\n3. **Counting Zeros in Products:** When multiplying numbers, the number of trailing zeros in the product is determined by the number of factors of 10, which is the minimum of the factors of 2 and 5 in the number.\n\n4. **Estimating Large Numbers:** For very large numbers, estimating the order of magnitude and the distribution of digits can help predict the number of zeros.\n\n5. **Verification Through Calculation:** Although direct calculation of such large numbers is impractical, understanding the pattern and structure can guide in estimating the number of zeros accurately.\n\nThese insights can help in accurately determining the number of zeros in the expansion of large numbers squared."}
