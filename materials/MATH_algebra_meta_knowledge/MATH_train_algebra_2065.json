{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Polynomial Degrees:** The degree of a polynomial is determined by the highest power of \\(x\\) with a non-zero coefficient. For example, the degree of \\(5x^4 - 3x^2 + 2x\\) is 4.\n\n2. **Coefficient Manipulation:** When adding or subtracting polynomials, focus on the coefficients of each power of \\(x\\). Ensure that you correctly combine the coefficients of like terms.\n\n3. **Setting Up for Degree Reduction:** To find \\(c\\) such that \\(f(x) + cg(x)\\) has a specific degree, identify the leading terms (those with the highest power) in both polynomials. For \\(f(x) + cg(x)\\) to have a degree of 3, the coefficient of the \\(x^4\\) term must be zero.\n\n4. **Solving for \\(c\\):** Set up an equation where the sum of the coefficients of the highest degree term (in this case, \\(x^4\\)) equals zero. Solve this equation for \\(c\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\(c\\), substitute it back into the expression \\(f(x) + cg(x)\\) to verify that the resulting polynomial indeed has the desired degree. This step ensures that no arithmetic or algebraic errors were made during the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
