{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Proportionality:** Recognize that if \\( x \\) is directly proportional to \\( y^3 \\), then \\( x = k y^3 \\) for some constant \\( k \\). If \\( y \\) is inversely proportional to \\( \\sqrt{z} \\), then \\( y = \frac{c}{\\sqrt{z}} \\) for some constant \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Combining Proportionalities:** Combine the given proportionalities to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( z \\). This involves substituting \\( y \\) from the second proportionality into the first.\n\n3. **Finding Constants:** Use the given values of \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) to determine the constants \\( k \\) and \\( c \\). This step requires solving simultaneous equations.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** Once the constants are known, substitute the new value of \\( z \\) into the combined proportionality to find the new value of \\( x \\). Ensure that the algebraic manipulations are correct and that the final answer is expressed as a common fraction.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify the consistency of the constants by substituting back the original values to ensure the derived formula is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
