{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Set Up Equations:** Translate the given information into algebraic equations. Use variables to represent the number of questions each person gets wrong.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you are dealing with a system of linear equations. Solve these equations step-by-step, ensuring each step is logically consistent.\n\n3. **Check Consistency:** Ensure that the equations are consistent with each other. For example, if one equation states that the sum of two variables equals a certain number, make sure no other equation contradicts this.\n\n4. **Substitute Known Values:** Use the information given directly in the problem (like Charlie getting five questions wrong) to simplify your equations.\n\n5. **Verify Solutions:** After finding a solution, verify it by substituting it back into the original equations to ensure it satisfies all conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
