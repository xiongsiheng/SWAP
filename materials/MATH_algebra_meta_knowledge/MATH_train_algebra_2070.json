{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the sum of an arithmetic series, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Series:** Confirm that the series is indeed arithmetic, meaning each term increases by a constant difference (in this case, 2).\n\n2. **Find the Number of Terms:** Use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic series: \\( n = \frac{\text{last term} - \text{first term}}{\text{common difference}} + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Sum Formula:** Apply the sum formula for an arithmetic series: \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic calculations, especially when determining \\( n \\) and when applying the sum formula.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify the sum by manually adding a few terms at the beginning and end of the series to ensure consistency with the calculated sum.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating the sum of such series."}
