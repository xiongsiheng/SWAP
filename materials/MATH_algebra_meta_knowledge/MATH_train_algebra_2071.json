{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when converting units of volume, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between Units:** Know the conversion factor between the units involved. In this case, one yard is equal to three feet.\n\n2. **Apply the Conversion Factor Correctly:** When converting cubic units, the conversion factor must be cubed. For example, if 1 yard equals 3 feet, then 1 cubic yard equals (3 feet)\u00b3.\n\n3. **Calculate Carefully:** Perform the arithmetic carefully to avoid mistakes. Multiply the conversion factor by itself three times to get the cubic conversion factor.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy. A simple mistake in multiplication can lead to an incorrect result.\n\n5. **Visualize the Conversion:** Visualizing the conversion can help in understanding the relationship between cubic feet and cubic yards. Imagine a cube that is 1 yard on each side, and then convert each side to feet to see how many cubic feet fit inside.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while converting units of volume."}
