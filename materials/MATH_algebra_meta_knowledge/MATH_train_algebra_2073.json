{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** The inverse of a function \\( f(x) \\) is denoted by \\( f^{-1}(x) \\). For a function and its inverse to intersect at a point, the point must satisfy both the function and its inverse. This means if \\( (x, y) \\) is a point on \\( f(x) \\), then \\( (y, x) \\) is a point on \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n2. **Intersection of Function and Inverse:** If a function \\( f(x) \\) and its inverse \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) intersect at a point \\( (a, b) \\), then \\( f(a) = b \\) and \\( f^{-1}(b) = a \\). Since \\( f \\) and \\( f^{-1} \\) are inverses, \\( f(b) = a \\) must also hold.\n\n3. **Substitution and Solving:** Substitute the given point into the function to find the relationship between the variables. For example, if the point is \\( (-3, a) \\), then \\( f(-3) = a \\). Solve for \\( a \\) using the function's equation.\n\n4. **Integer Constraints:** Given that both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers, ensure your final solution respects this constraint. This can help in narrowing down possible values and verifying the correctness of your solution.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting the values back into both the function and its inverse to ensure they intersect at the given point. This step will catch any errors in reasoning or calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
