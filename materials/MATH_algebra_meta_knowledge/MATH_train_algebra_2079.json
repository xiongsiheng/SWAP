{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving inversely varying quantities, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Variation:** Remember that if two quantities \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) vary inversely, their product is a constant. This means \\( r \times s = k \\) for some constant \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Finding the Constant:** Use the given values of \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) to find the constant \\( k \\). For example, if \\( r = 1200 \\) and \\( s = 0.35 \\), then \\( k = 1200 \times 0.35 \\).\n\n3. **Using the Constant:** Once you have determined \\( k \\), use it to find the new value of \\( s \\) when \\( r \\) changes. If \\( r \\) becomes \\( 2400 \\), then \\( s = \frac{k}{2400} \\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that you perform multiplication and division accurately, especially when dealing with decimal numbers. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Rounding Correctly:** When expressing your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandths, round appropriately. For example, if the result is \\( 0.1754 \\), round it to \\( 0.175 \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inversely varying quantities."}
