{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Order:** Choose the most straightforward equation to start with for substitution. In this case, you might start with the equation \\(c - 1 = d\\) to express \\(d\\) in terms of \\(c\\).\n\n2. **Eliminate Variables:** Use the relationships between variables to eliminate them step by step. For example, after finding \\(d\\) in terms of \\(c\\), substitute \\(d\\) into other equations to reduce the number of variables.\n\n3. **Check for Linear Dependencies:** Ensure that the equations are not linearly dependent, which could lead to an infinite number of solutions or no solution at all.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with multiple coefficients and constants. Errors in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After finding the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\), multiply them together and verify that the product matches the given sum in the first equation. This step ensures that all substitutions and calculations were correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such systems of equations."}
