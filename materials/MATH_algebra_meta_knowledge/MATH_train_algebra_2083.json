{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that solving for \\( t \\) in \\( t^2 = 36 \\) involves finding the square roots of 36. The equation \\( t^2 = 36 \\) has two solutions: \\( t = 6 \\) and \\( t = -6 \\), because both \\( 6^2 \\) and \\( (-6)^2 \\) equal 36.\n\n2. **Product of Solutions:** When asked to find the product of all values of \\( t \\), multiply the solutions together. For quadratic equations of the form \\( t^2 = k \\), the product of the solutions \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_2 \\) is always \\( t_1 \times t_2 = -k \\) if \\( k \\) is negative, and \\( t_1 \times t_2 = k \\) if \\( k \\) is positive.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your multiplication to ensure accuracy, as simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **General Rule for Quadratics:** Remember that for any quadratic equation \\( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \\), if \\( t_1 \\) and \\( t_2 \\) are the solutions, their product is given by \\( t_1 \times t_2 = \frac{c}{a} \\). This rule can be applied directly when the quadratic simplifies to \\( t^2 = k \\), where \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( c = k \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
