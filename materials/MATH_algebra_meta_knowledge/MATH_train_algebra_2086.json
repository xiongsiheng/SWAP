{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Circle Equation:** Recall that the standard form of a circle's equation is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** To convert the given equation into the standard form, you need to complete the square for both the x and y terms. This involves adding and subtracting appropriate constants to form perfect squares.\n\n3. **Matching Radius:** Once you have the equation in the standard form, compare the radius term with the given radius (6 in this case). This will allow you to solve for the unknown variable (k).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that your calculations are accurate when completing the square and solving for k. Errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect values.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the value of k, substitute it back into the original equation and check if it indeed represents a circle of the specified radius. This step helps confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
