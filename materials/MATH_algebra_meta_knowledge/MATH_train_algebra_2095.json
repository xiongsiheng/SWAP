{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the 20th triangular number, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formula for Triangular Numbers:** The nth triangular number can be calculated using the formula \\(T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\). This formula directly computes the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that calculations involving the formula are done with precision. Errors often occur in multiplication and division, so double-check these steps.\n\n3. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that each triangular number represents the sum of all numbers up to a certain point (e.g., 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, etc.). This understanding helps in verifying the correctness of the formula application.\n\n4. **Verification:** After calculating the 20th triangular number, consider verifying it by checking against known properties of triangular numbers or by calculating a smaller triangular number correctly and comparing the method and result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for triangular numbers."}
