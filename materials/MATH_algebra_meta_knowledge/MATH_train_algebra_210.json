{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Multiples:** Recognize that the first ten positive multiples of 13 are 13, 26, 39, ..., up to the tenth multiple. This sequence is an arithmetic series where each term increases by 13.\n\n2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Series:** Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a \\) is the first term, and \\( l \\) is the last term.\n\n3. **Calculating the Last Term:** Determine the last term of the series by multiplying the common difference (13) by the number of terms minus one (since the first term is already 13).\n\n4. **Avoiding Calculation Mistakes:** Be meticulous with your calculations, especially when multiplying and adding large numbers. Double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your sum by manually adding the first few multiples and comparing with your calculated sum to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
