{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up the Equation:** Translate the problem statement into a mathematical equation accurately. Ensure that the operations described (addition, subtraction, squaring) are correctly represented.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Equation:** When simplifying the equation, be careful with operations involving squares and roots. For example, \\((x - 17)^2\\) expands to \\(x^2 - 34x + 289\\), not just \\(x^2 - 17^2\\).\n\n3. **Solving for the Variable:** Use appropriate algebraic techniques to solve for the variable. This might involve factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the solutions, substitute them back into the original equation to verify that they satisfy the conditions of the problem. This step helps to identify any extraneous solutions or calculation errors.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to details, especially in arithmetic and algebraic manipulations, as small errors can significantly impact the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
