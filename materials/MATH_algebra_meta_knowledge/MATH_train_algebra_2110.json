{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Piecewise Functions:** Ensure you clearly understand the conditions under which each piece of the piecewise function is applied. Misinterpreting the conditions can lead to incorrect evaluations.\n\n2. **Nested Function Evaluation:** When evaluating a function within itself (as in \\(p(p(1,-1),p(-5,-2))\\)), start by evaluating the innermost function first. This approach helps in systematically breaking down the problem.\n\n3. **Careful Application of Conditions:** Apply the conditions of the piecewise function accurately. For instance, check whether \\(x \\ge 0\\) and \\(y \\ge 0\\), or \\(x < 0\\) and \\(y < 0\\), or otherwise, before selecting the correct formula to use.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and when combining results from different pieces of the function.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your final result by substituting the values back into the function definitions to ensure they match the expected conditions and results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
