{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Prime Numbers:** Recall the definition of prime numbers and ensure that the numbers you consider are indeed prime. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Sequence:** Understand the properties of an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a fixed amount (the common difference). In this case, the common difference is 6.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic:** Use modular arithmetic to analyze the ones digit of numbers. For example, consider the ones digit of numbers modulo 10, as this will help determine the ones digit of the prime numbers in the sequence.\n\n4. **Checking for Primes:** When identifying primes in an arithmetic sequence, check for divisibility rules, especially for small factors like 2, 3, and 5, which can quickly eliminate non-prime numbers.\n\n5. **Systematic Approach:** Systematically check each possible starting prime number and its subsequent terms in the sequence to ensure they are all prime, given the common difference.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
