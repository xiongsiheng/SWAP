{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the given information. For example, if the sum of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is 50, you can write \\( x + y = 50 \\). If their difference is 6, you can write \\( x - y = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Solving for Variables:** Solve the system of equations to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). You can use substitution or elimination methods to find these values.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), verify that their sum and difference match the given conditions.\n\n4. **Calculating the Product:** Once you have the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), multiply them to find their product. Double-check your multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the solution is consistent with the original problem statement by verifying the sum and difference of the numbers.\n\nThese steps will help minimize mistakes and ensure accurate results when solving problems involving the sum and difference of numbers."}
