{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Compound Interest:** The formula for compound interest is \\( A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt} \\), where \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest; \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money); \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal); \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year; and \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\n2. **Correctly Applying the Formula:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the values into the compound interest formula. Pay special attention to the interest rate (as a decimal), the number of times interest is compounded per year, and the total time period.\n\n3. **Solving for the Principal:** When solving for the principal \\( P \\), rearrange the compound interest formula to isolate \\( P \\). This involves taking the final amount \\( A \\) and dividing by the compound interest factor.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Perform all calculations carefully, especially when dealing with exponents and decimals. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the initial investment, verify your answer by plugging it back into the compound interest formula to ensure it results in the correct final amount.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving compound interest."}
