{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recursive Formulation:** Recognize that the expression is a recursive form, where the same pattern repeats inside the square root. This can be represented as a variable equation, such as \\( x = \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}} \\), leading to \\( x = \\sqrt{2 - x} \\).\n\n2. **Solving the Equation:** When you derive the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{2 - x} \\), square both sides to eliminate the square root. This will give you a quadratic equation which can be solved for \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving the quadratic equation, check both solutions to see if they satisfy the original recursive form. One solution might not fit, as it could be an extraneous solution introduced by squaring both sides.\n\n4. **Precision in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with nested radicals and solving quadratic equations, as small errors can significantly impact the final result.\n\n5. **Understanding Convergence:** Understand that this type of infinite nested radical converges to a specific value, and the solution should reflect this convergence. Ensure your final answer aligns with the expected behavior of such expressions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
