{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Consecutive Numbers:** Consecutive even numbers differ by 2. For example, if the smallest number is \\( n \\), the next four numbers would be \\( n+2 \\), \\( n+4 \\), \\( n+6 \\), and \\( n+8 \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find the smallest number in a set of consecutive even numbers given their sum, set up an equation where the sum of the numbers equals the given total. For five consecutive even numbers starting with \\( n \\), the sum is \\( n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) \\).\n\n3. **Simplifying the Equation:** Combine like terms in your equation to simplify it. For the example given, the sum simplifies to \\( 5n + 20 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( n \\):** Equate the simplified sum to the given total (320 in this case) and solve for \\( n \\). This involves basic algebraic manipulation to isolate \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find \\( n \\), verify by calculating the sum of the five numbers using \\( n \\) and ensuring it matches the given sum. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving consecutive even numbers."}
