{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Greatest Common Factor (GCF):** Start by identifying the greatest common factor of all terms in the expression. This is the largest number (and variable, if applicable) that can be evenly divided into each term.\n\n2. **Factor Out the GCF:** Once you've identified the GCF, factor it out of each term in the expression. This involves dividing each term by the GCF and writing the result as a product of the GCF and the simplified term.\n\n3. **Check Your Work:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure that you get the original expression. This step helps verify that your factoring was correct.\n\n4. **Simplify Completely:** Make sure that the expression is factored as much as possible. Sometimes, terms can be further simplified or combined.\n\n5. **Pay Attention to Signs:** Be careful with negative signs when factoring. Ensure that the signs of the terms are correctly maintained throughout the factoring process.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when factoring expressions."}
