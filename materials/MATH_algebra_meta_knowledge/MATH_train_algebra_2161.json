{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the value of \\( k \\) that makes \\( x^2 - 16x + k \\) the square of a binomial, consider the following:\n\n1. **Perfect Square Trinomial:** Recall that a perfect square trinomial takes the form \\( (x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2 \\). Identify the relationship between the coefficient of \\( x \\) and the constant term.\n\n2. **Coefficient Matching:** For \\( x^2 - 16x + k \\) to be a perfect square, the coefficient of \\( x \\) (which is -16) must match \\( -2a \\). Solve for \\( a \\) using \\( -2a = -16 \\).\n\n3. **Determine \\( k \\):** Once \\( a \\) is found, calculate \\( k \\) as \\( a^2 \\). This ensures that the trinomial is indeed the square of \\( (x - a) \\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, expand \\( (x - a)^2 \\) to verify that it matches \\( x^2 - 16x + k \\), ensuring no errors in the calculation of \\( k \\).\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the value of \\( k \\) needed to make the given quadratic expression a perfect square trinomial."}
