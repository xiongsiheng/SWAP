{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction of Equations:** When adding or subtracting equations, ensure that you correctly align and combine like terms. This can help in eliminating variables and simplifying the system.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** If you choose to use the substitution method, make sure to substitute correctly and check that the expressions are equivalent after substitution.\n\n3. **Consistency Check:** After solving for individual variables, substitute the values back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy all conditions.\n\n4. **Linear Combinations:** Be precise when using linear combinations of equations to eliminate variables. Misaligning terms or incorrect arithmetic can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\n5. **Final Expression Calculation:** When calculating the final expression (e.g., \\(2a + 2b + 2c\\)), double-check your arithmetic to ensure that the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are correctly substituted and summed.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
