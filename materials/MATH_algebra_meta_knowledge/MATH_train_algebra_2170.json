{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving ceiling functions and square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function \\(\\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil\\) returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). Ensure you correctly identify the integer part of the square root.\n\n2. **Approximating Square Roots:** Use known approximations or a calculator to find the exact values of square roots. For example, \\(\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\), \\(\\sqrt{22} \\approx 4.69\\), and \\(\\sqrt{222} \\approx 14.899\\).\n\n3. **Applying Ceiling Function:** Apply the ceiling function to these approximations to get the smallest integers greater than these values: \\(\\left\\lceil \\sqrt{2} \\right\\rceil = 2\\), \\(\\left\\lceil \\sqrt{22} \\right\\rceil = 5\\), and \\(\\left\\lceil \\sqrt{222} \\right\\rceil = 15\\).\n\n4. **Summing the Results:** Add the results of the ceiling functions carefully to get the final answer. Ensure there are no arithmetic errors in this step.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your calculations by checking the ceiling function application and the summation for any discrepancies.\n\nThese guidelines should help minimize errors in evaluating such expressions."}
