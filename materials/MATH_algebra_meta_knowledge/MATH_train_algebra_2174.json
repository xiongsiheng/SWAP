{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Clearing Fractions:** If the equation involves fractions, consider multiplying through by the denominator to clear the fraction. This can simplify the equation and make it easier to solve.\n\n2. **Expanding and Simplifying:** After clearing fractions or performing any multiplication, expand and simplify both sides of the equation. Ensure that you distribute correctly and combine like terms.\n\n3. **Setting Up for Factoring:** Look for common factors or patterns that suggest the equation can be factored. Factoring can often simplify the process of finding solutions.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** When dealing with rational expressions, solutions that make the original denominator zero are extraneous. Always check that your solutions do not create a division by zero.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Substitute your final answers back into the original equation to verify they satisfy the equation. This step is crucial to ensure that no mistakes were made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
