{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of product, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution:** Before performing any calculations, substitute the given value of \\(a\\) into the expression. In this case, replace \\(a\\) with 2.\n\n2. **Sequence of Multiplication:** Ensure that you correctly list and multiply the terms in the sequence from \\( (a-10) \\) to \\( a \\). For \\(a = 2\\), this sequence would be \\( (2-10), (2-9), \\ldots, (2-1), 2 \\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Operations:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations, especially subtraction and multiplication. Simple arithmetic errors can significantly alter the result.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify each term in the sequence before multiplying them together. This can help reduce the complexity of the multiplication and minimize errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the product, consider verifying the result by checking the multiplication steps or using a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such products."}
