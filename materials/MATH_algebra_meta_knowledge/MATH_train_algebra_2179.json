{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding products of binomials, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **FOIL Method:** Use the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) to ensure you multiply all pairs of terms correctly. This method helps in systematically multiplying the first terms, the outer terms, the inner terms, and the last terms of the binomials.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** After applying the FOIL method, combine like terms. This step is crucial as it simplifies the expression and ensures that all similar terms are added together.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially addition and multiplication, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Check Your Work:** After completing the expansion, it can be helpful to substitute a simple value for \\(x\\) into both the original expression and your expanded form to verify that they yield the same result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding binomial products."}
