{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Analyzing Piecewise Functions:** Understand that a piecewise function has different definitions for different intervals of the input variable. Identify which part of the function definition applies based on the given condition.\n\n2. **Solving Equations:** When solving for \\( x \\) in each part of the piecewise function, ensure you use the correct equation corresponding to the interval where \\( x \\) lies.\n\n3. **Checking Interval Conditions:** After solving for \\( x \\), verify that the solution falls within the correct interval specified by the function definition. Solutions outside the specified interval are invalid.\n\n4. **Summing Solutions:** If there are multiple valid solutions, sum them correctly. Ensure that each solution is counted only once and that arithmetic operations are performed accurately.\n\n5. **Double-Check Work:** Always recheck your calculations and the application of the function rules to ensure that no mistakes were made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
