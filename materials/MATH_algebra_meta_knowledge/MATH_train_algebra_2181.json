{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for common integer solutions among multiple inequalities, consider the following:\n\n1. **Isolate Variables:** Start by isolating the variable \\( y \\) in each inequality. This typically involves performing operations to get \\( y \\) on one side of the inequality.\n\n2. **Understand Inequality Directions:** Remember that when you multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality direction. This is crucial to avoid errors.\n\n3. **Find Intersection of Ranges:** Determine the range of \\( y \\) that satisfies each individual inequality. Then, find the intersection of these ranges to identify where all inequalities are simultaneously satisfied.\n\n4. **Check Integer Solutions:** Once you have the range of \\( y \\) that satisfies all inequalities, count the integer values within this range. Ensure you include the boundary points if they are integers and satisfy all inequalities.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify each integer solution by substituting it back into the original inequalities to confirm it satisfies all conditions.\n\nThese steps help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when determining common integer solutions to multiple inequalities."}
