{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Distances:** Ensure you correctly interpret distances in the context of the problem. For instance, a point being 5 units from the line \\( y = 13 \\) means the point's \\( y \\)-coordinate is either 8 or 18.\n\n2. **Using the Distance Formula:** When calculating the distance from a point to another point, use the distance formula \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\). Be meticulous with the coordinates and the arithmetic.\n\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:** Recognize that symmetry can simplify the problem. Since the points are equidistant from a specific line and point, they will likely be symmetrically placed around the given line and point.\n\n4. **Checking All Possibilities:** Ensure you consider all possible points that meet the given conditions. For example, a point 13 units from (7, 13) could be in four different quadrants relative to the given point.\n\n5. **Coordinate Sum Calculation:** When summing the coordinates of multiple points, double-check the addition to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
