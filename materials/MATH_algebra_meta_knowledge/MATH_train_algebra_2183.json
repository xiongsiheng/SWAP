{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents:** Remember the rules of exponents, such as \\(a^0 = 1\\) for any non-zero \\(a\\), and \\(a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** Simplify fractions by canceling out common factors in the numerator and the denominator.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Apply the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) correctly, which means handling exponents before division.\n\n4. **Calculating with Powers of 10:** When dealing with powers of 10, use the fact that \\(10^{-n}\\) is equivalent to \\(\frac{1}{10^n}\\), and \\(10^n\\) is simply \\(1\\) followed by \\(n\\) zeros.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each step, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with negative and zero exponents.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
