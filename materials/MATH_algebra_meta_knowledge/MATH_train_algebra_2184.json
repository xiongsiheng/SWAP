{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Intersection of Lines and Parabolas:** To find the points of intersection between a horizontal line \\( y = k \\) and a quadratic function \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), set the equations equal to each other: \\( k = ax^2 + bx + c \\). This will give you a quadratic equation in \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the intersection points. Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Distance Between Points:** The distance between two points \\( (x_1, y) \\) and \\( (x_2, y) \\) on a horizontal line is given by \\( |x_1 - x_2| \\). For this problem, calculate the difference between the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the intersection points.\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions:** When dealing with expressions involving square roots, simplify them to their simplest form. Ensure that the numerator and denominator are in their lowest terms and that there are no common factors between them.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, to avoid arithmetic errors. Ensure that the final expression for the distance is in the form \\( \frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
