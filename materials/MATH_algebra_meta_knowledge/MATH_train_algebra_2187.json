{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rates:** Recognize that the problem involves a rate (painting a wall per unit of time). In this case, Heidi's rate is 1 wall per 45 minutes.\n\n2. **Proportional Thinking:** Understand that the amount of wall painted is directly proportional to the time spent painting. This means that for any given time, the fraction of the wall painted can be calculated by dividing the time spent by the total time required to paint the entire wall.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** After calculating the fraction, simplify it to its lowest terms to ensure accuracy. This involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that the division and simplification steps are performed correctly to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the answer by checking if the fraction makes sense in the context of the problem (e.g., if Heidi paints for 45 minutes, the fraction should be 1, indicating a complete wall).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
