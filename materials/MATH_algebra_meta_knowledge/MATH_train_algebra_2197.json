{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Linear Functions:** Recall that a linear function can be expressed as \\( f(x) = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept. The slope \\( m \\) is constant across the function.\n\n2. **Slope Calculation:** The slope of a linear function can be calculated using the formula \\( m = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} \\). For this problem, you can use the given information \\( f(6) - f(2) = 12 \\) to find the slope.\n\n3. **Applying the Slope:** Once the slope is determined, use it to find \\( f(12) - f(2) \\). Since the slope is constant, the difference in function values over the same interval will be proportional to the slope.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the calculations are consistent with the properties of linear functions. For instance, the difference in function values over equal intervals should be the same.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when calculating the slope and applying it to find the required function difference.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
