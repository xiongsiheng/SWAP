{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the midpoint of a segment with given endpoints, remember the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint \\( M \\) of a segment with endpoints \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by the formula \\( M = \\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \\).\n\n2. **Correct Calculation:** Ensure that you correctly add the corresponding coordinates of the endpoints and then divide by 2. Misplacing or miscalculating these sums can lead to incorrect midpoints.\n\n3. **Sign Errors:** Be cautious with negative numbers, especially when adding coordinates. A common error is to incorrectly handle the signs, leading to an incorrect midpoint.\n\n4. **Double-Check Coordinates:** After calculating the midpoint, double-check that you have correctly computed both the x and y coordinates separately.\n\n5. **Simplification:** Make sure that the coordinates of the midpoint are in their simplest form, without any unnecessary fractions or decimals.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the midpoint of a segment."}
