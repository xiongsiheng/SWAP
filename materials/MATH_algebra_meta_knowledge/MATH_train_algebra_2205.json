{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Relationships:** Clearly identify the relationships between the weights of the objects. In this case, the relationship is that seven bowling balls weigh the same as four canoes.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the given information into mathematical equations. For instance, if three canoes weigh 84 pounds, you can determine the weight of one canoe.\n\n3. **Solving for One Unit:** Calculate the weight of one unit (one canoe in this case) before proceeding to find the weight of the other unit (one bowling ball).\n\n4. **Using Proportions:** Use the established relationship to set up a proportion or equation involving the weights of the bowling balls and canoes.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when dividing or multiplying to find the weight of one unit from a given total weight.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you have the weight of one bowling ball, verify by checking if seven bowling balls indeed weigh the same as four canoes using the calculated weights.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
