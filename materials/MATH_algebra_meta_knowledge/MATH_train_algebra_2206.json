{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rationalization:** Rationalizing the denominator involves eliminating any radicals from the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by an appropriate expression.\n\n2. **Choosing the Correct Conjugate:** For a single term in the denominator like a square root, multiply by a fraction that has the same radical in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n3. **Maintaining Equivalence:** Ensure that you multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same value to maintain the equivalence of the fraction.\n\n4. **Simplifying Correctly:** After rationalizing, simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms and simplifying any square roots.\n\n5. **Checking the Result:** Verify that the denominator no longer contains any radicals and that the expression is simplified correctly.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and correctness in rationalizing denominators involving square roots."}
