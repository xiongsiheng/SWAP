{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Roots and Coefficients:** Recall the relationships between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), if \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are the roots, then \\(r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a}\\) and \\(r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \frac{c}{a}\\).\n\n2. **Transforming Roots:** If the roots of one quadratic equation are transformed (e.g., increased by a constant), use the properties of the roots to find the new quadratic equation. For example, if the roots of \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\), and the new roots are \\(r_1 + k\\) and \\(r_2 + k\\), the new quadratic will have coefficients related to the original ones.\n\n3. **Calculating the New Constant Term:** When the roots are shifted by a constant \\(k\\), the new constant term \\(c\\) in the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + bx + c = 0\\) can be found by calculating the product of the new roots.\n\n4. **Avoiding Algebraic Mistakes:** Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with expressions involving both the original and transformed roots. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the value of \\(c\\), consider substituting the roots back into the new quadratic equation to verify that they satisfy the equation, which helps in catching any algebraic errors made during the process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
