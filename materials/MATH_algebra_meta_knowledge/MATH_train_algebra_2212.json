{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identifying Patterns:** Look for patterns or algebraic identities that can simplify the expression. For example, recognize that the numerator resembles a polynomial that might simplify using the difference of cubes or other algebraic identities.\n\n2. **Factorization Techniques:** Use factorization techniques to simplify the numerator. For instance, if the expression can be factored into simpler terms, it might reduce the complexity of the problem.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure precise arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers or exponents. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** Consider substituting simpler variables or values to simplify the expression. For example, if \\( x = 2013 \\) and \\( y = 2014 \\), rewrite the expression in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding a solution, verify the result by substituting it back into the original expression to ensure it holds True. This step is crucial to catch any errors made during the simplification or calculation process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
