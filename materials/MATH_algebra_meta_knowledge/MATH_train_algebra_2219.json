{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Remember the quadratic formula for solving quadratic equations of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\): \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). This formula will give you the roots \\(d\\) and \\(e\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant:** The discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) should be calculated first to ensure the equation has real solutions. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\n3. **Symmetry in Roots:** For a quadratic equation, the sum of the roots \\(d + e\\) is given by \\(-b/a\\) and the product of the roots \\(de\\) is given by \\(c/a\\). These properties can simplify calculations.\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions:** When calculating \\((d - e)^2\\), use the identity \\((d - e)^2 = (d + e)^2 - 4de\\). This avoids directly calculating \\(d - e\\), which can be more error-prone.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, as these can introduce errors if not handled carefully.\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding \\((d - e)^2\\), consider verifying the calculation by substituting the roots back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
