{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution:** When substituting the given value of \\( y \\) into the equation, ensure that you replace \\( y \\) correctly and avoid any typographical errors.\n\n2. **Solving Linear Equations:** When solving for \\( x \\), isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. Perform operations in a step-by-step manner to avoid mistakes, especially when dealing with fractions.\n\n3. **Check for Division by Zero:** Ensure that the expression in the denominator does not equal zero at any step, as division by zero is undefined.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and simplifying expressions.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute the calculated value of \\( x \\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
