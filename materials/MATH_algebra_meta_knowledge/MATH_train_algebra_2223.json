{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the polynomial function \\( p(x) \\) in this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Polynomial Addition:** When adding polynomials, combine like terms. This means adding coefficients of terms with the same degree.\n\n2. **Isolating \\( p(x) \\):** To find \\( p(x) \\), subtract the given polynomial on the right-hand side from both sides of the equation. This will isolate \\( p(x) \\) on one side.\n\n3. **Degree Order:** When expressing \\( p(x) \\) as a polynomial, list the terms in decreasing order of their degrees. This helps in clearly presenting the polynomial and avoids misrepresentation.\n\n4. **Coefficient Accuracy:** Ensure that you accurately calculate the coefficients of each term in \\( p(x) \\) by correctly performing the subtraction of the polynomials.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( p(x) \\), you can verify your solution by substituting \\( p(x) \\) back into the original equation and checking if both sides are equal. This step helps catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( p(x) \\) in such problems."}
