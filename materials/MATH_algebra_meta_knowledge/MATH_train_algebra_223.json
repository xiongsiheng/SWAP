{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) correctly into the expression. Double-check that you have replaced every instance of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) with their respective values.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating the expression. This means performing exponentiation before multiplication and addition.\n\n3. **Exponentiation:** Be careful when calculating powers. For example, \\( 2^3 \\) is 8, not 6 or 9. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to addition and multiplication. Ensure that you are adding and multiplying the correct terms and that your calculations are precise.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the value of the expression, consider reviewing your steps to ensure that each operation was performed correctly. This can help catch any mistakes that might have been made during the evaluation process.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate evaluation of the expression."}
