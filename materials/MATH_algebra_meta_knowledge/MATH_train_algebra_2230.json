{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function, denoted by \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\), returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lceil 3.7 \\rceil = 4\\) and \\(\\lceil -2.3 \\rceil = -2\\).\n\n2. **Range of Values for \\(\\sqrt{x}\\):** If \\(\\lceil \\sqrt{x} \\rceil = 15\\), then \\(14 < \\sqrt{x} \\leq 15\\). This is because \\(\\lceil \\sqrt{x} \\rceil = 15\\) means \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is between 14 and 15, inclusive of 15 but not 14.\n\n3. **Squaring the Inequality:** To find the range of \\(x\\), square both sides of the inequality \\(14 < \\sqrt{x} \\leq 15\\). This gives \\(196 < x \\leq 225\\).\n\n4. **Counting Integer Solutions:** The integer values of \\(x\\) within the range \\(196 < x \\leq 225\\) are all the integers from 197 to 225, inclusive. To count these, calculate \\(225 - 197 + 1\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Always double-check the calculations for counting the integer solutions and ensure the range is correctly derived from the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
