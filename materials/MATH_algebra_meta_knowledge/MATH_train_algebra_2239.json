{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the 25th term of an arithmetic sequence, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Difference:** Determine the common difference (d) of the sequence, which is the difference between any two consecutive terms. In this case, d = 5 - 2 = 3.\n\n2. **Use the Formula for the nth Term:** The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Substitute Correctly:** Ensure you substitute the correct values into the formula. For the 25th term, \\(a_1 = 2\\), \\(d = 3\\), and \\(n = 25\\).\n\n4. **Perform Calculations Carefully:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations, especially multiplication and addition, to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check the Result:** After calculating the 25th term, verify the result by ensuring it aligns with the pattern of the sequence.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors when determining the nth term of an arithmetic sequence."}
