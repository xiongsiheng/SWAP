{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the bacteria are growing exponentially, meaning they triple in number every 20 seconds. This is a geometric progression.\n\n2. **Time Conversion:** Convert the total time given (three minutes) into the number of 20-second intervals. This helps in determining how many times the bacteria have tripled.\n\n3. **Using the Formula for Geometric Progression:** Use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, \\( a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1} \\), where \\( a_n \\) is the number of bacteria after n intervals, \\( a_1 \\) is the initial number of bacteria, and \\( r \\) is the common ratio (3 in this case).\n\n4. **Solving for the Initial Amount:** Rearrange the formula to solve for \\( a_1 \\) (the initial number of bacteria).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations, especially those involving exponents and divisions, are performed accurately to avoid errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
