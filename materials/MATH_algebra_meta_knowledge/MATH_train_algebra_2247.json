{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. For example, let \\( p \\) be the cost of a pencil and \\( q \\) be the cost of a pen. From the problem, you can derive equations like \\( 5p + q = 2.50 \\) and \\( p + 2q = 1.85 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneously:** Use algebraic methods (such as substitution or elimination) to solve the system of equations simultaneously. Ensure that you correctly manipulate the equations to isolate variables.\n\n3. **Check Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with decimals, to avoid simple mistakes.\n\n4. **Substitute Back:** Once you find the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:** Use the derived values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) to calculate the cost of two pencils and one pen, ensuring you apply the correct arithmetic operations.\n\nThese steps will help minimize mistakes and ensure accuracy in solving the problem."}
