{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the point of intersection of two lines, consider the following:\n\n1. **Set Equations Equal:** To find the intersection, set the equations equal to each other by substituting one equation into the other. For example, substitute \\( y = 4x - 19 \\) into \\( 2x + y = 95 \\) to eliminate \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\( x \\):** After substituting, solve the resulting equation for \\( x \\). Ensure you correctly handle the algebraic operations, especially when combining like terms or isolating \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Check Your Solution:** Once you find \\( x \\), substitute it back into either original equation to find \\( y \\) and verify that the point \\((x, y)\\) satisfies both equations.\n\n4. **Avoid Common Errors:** Common errors include incorrect substitution, mistakes in algebraic manipulation, or miscalculations. Double-checking each step can help catch these errors.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, you can graph the lines to visually confirm the intersection point, which can serve as a useful cross-check.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy in finding the intersection point of two lines."}
