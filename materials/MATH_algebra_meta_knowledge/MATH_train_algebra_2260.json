{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\lfloor x \rfloor - x \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:** The floor function \\( \\lfloor x \rfloor \\) gives the largest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\). This means \\( \\lfloor x \rfloor \\) is an integer and \\( \\lfloor x \rfloor \\leq x < \\lfloor x \rfloor + 1 \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Function \\( f(x) \\):** Since \\( \\lfloor x \rfloor \\) is an integer, \\( f(x) = \\lfloor x \rfloor - x \\) represents the difference between \\( x \\) and the integer part of \\( x \\). This difference is always between 0 and -1 (inclusive of -1 but exclusive of 0).\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** When expressing the range in interval notation, remember that the range includes all values from -1 up to, but not including, 0. The correct interval notation for this range is \\( [-1, 0) \\).\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Ensure that you correctly identify the boundaries of the interval. The lower bound -1 is included because \\( \\lfloor x \rfloor \\) can equal \\( x \\) when \\( x \\) is an integer, making \\( f(x) = -1 \\). The upper bound 0 is excluded because \\( \\lfloor x \rfloor \\) can never be greater than \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Consistency in Notation:** Be consistent and accurate in using interval notation, ensuring that parentheses and brackets are correctly placed to indicate whether the endpoints are included or excluded.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while determining the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\lfloor x \rfloor - x \\)."}
