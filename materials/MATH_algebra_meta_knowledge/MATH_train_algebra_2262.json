{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly identify what is being asked and the relationships between the given amounts and conditions.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use variables to represent the unknown amounts (e.g., Al's original amount as \\( A \\), Betty's as \\( B \\), and Clare's as \\( C \\)). Establish equations based on the given conditions (e.g., \\( A + B + C = 1000 \\) and \\( 2B + 2C - 100 = 1500 \\)).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Use algebraic methods to solve for the variables. Ensure that you handle each equation correctly and check for consistency.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with money amounts, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Validating the Solution:** Substitute the calculated values back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy all given constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
