{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Fractions:** When dealing with fractions, simplify them as much as possible. For example, \\(\\frac{16}{44}\\) can be simplified to \\(\\frac{4}{11}\\).\n\n2. **Square Roots and Squares:** Be precise when calculating square roots and squares. For instance, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{(2+\\sqrt{5})^2}{11}}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{2+\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}}\\).\n\n3. **Signs of Variables:** Pay attention to the signs of variables, especially when they are specified (e.g., \\(a\\) is negative and \\(b\\) is positive). This affects the outcome of operations involving these variables.\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions with Radicals:** When simplifying expressions involving radicals, ensure that you handle the radicals correctly. For example, \\((a+b)^3\\) might involve combining terms under a common radical or simplifying the expression step by step.\n\n5. **Verification of Simplified Form:** After simplifying the expression to the form \\(\\frac{x\\sqrt{y}}{z}\\), verify that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are indeed positive integers and that the expression is in its simplest form.\n\n6. **Sum Calculation:** Finally, when calculating the sum \\(x + y + z\\), ensure that you add the correct values obtained from the simplified expression.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
