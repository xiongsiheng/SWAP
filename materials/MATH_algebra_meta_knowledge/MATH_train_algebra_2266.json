{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the minimum value of a quadratic expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** The minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n2. **Quadratic Functions:** Remember that if the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) (a) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and thus the vertex represents a minimum. If a is negative, the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex represents a maximum.\n\n3. **Substitution:** Once you find the x-coordinate of the vertex, substitute it back into the original quadratic expression to find the corresponding y-value, which gives the minimum or maximum value of the function.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for finding the vertex and substituting back into the function to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, you can sketch a quick graph of the quadratic function to visually confirm the location of the vertex and the direction of the parabola.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the minimum value of a quadratic expression."}
