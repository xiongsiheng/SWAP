{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:** Parallel lines have the same slope. Identify the slope of each line by rewriting the equations in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m represents the slope.\n\n2. **Slope-Intercept Form:** Convert each equation to the form y = mx + b. For the first equation, solve for y to get y = 3x + a. For the second equation, solve for y to get y = (a + 6)x - 1.\n\n3. **Equating Slopes:** Since the lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Set the slopes from the two equations equal to each other: 3 = a + 6.\n\n4. **Solving for a:** Solve the resulting equation for a, ensuring you perform the correct algebraic operations to isolate a.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by substituting the value of a back into the equations to confirm that the slopes are indeed equal.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving the problem."}
