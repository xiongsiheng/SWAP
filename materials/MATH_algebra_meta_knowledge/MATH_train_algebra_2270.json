{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying and writing an expression as a polynomial, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms. This involves adding or subtracting terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying expressions. This ensures that operations are performed in the correct sequence.\n\n4. **Careful Subtraction:** When subtracting polynomials, distribute the negative sign through the second polynomial correctly to avoid sign errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After simplifying, it can be helpful to check your work by substituting a simple value for \\( x \\) into the original expression and your simplified form to ensure they yield the same result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying and writing expressions as polynomials."}
