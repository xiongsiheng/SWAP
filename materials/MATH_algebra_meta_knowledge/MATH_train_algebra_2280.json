{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Completing the Square:** Completing the square involves transforming a quadratic expression from the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) to an equivalent expression of the form \\((x + d)^2 + e\\). This process requires adding and subtracting the square of half the coefficient of \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Matching Coefficients:** When you rewrite the quadratic in the form \\((x + m)^2 + 8\\), ensure that the coefficients match the original quadratic. Specifically, the constant term in the expanded form of \\((x + m)^2 + 8\\) should equal 44.\n\n3. **Calculating \\(m\\):** To find \\(m\\), you need to equate the constant term from the completed square form to the constant term in the original quadratic. This involves solving for \\(m\\) such that the constant term in \\((x + m)^2 + 8\\) equals 44.\n\n4. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Pay close attention to your calculations, especially when squaring \\(m\\) and adding 8 to ensure that the final result matches the original quadratic's constant term.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your calculated value of \\(b\\) back into the original quadratic to verify that it matches the form \\((x + m)^2 + 8\\), ensuring accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
