{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** Recall that for a polynomial of the form \\(x^2 - kx + 16\\), if the roots are \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\), then \\(r_1 + r_2 = k\\) and \\(r_1 \\cdot r_2 = 16\\). This directly relates the coefficients of the polynomial to the sum and product of its roots.\n\n2. **Factorization of Constants:** Identify all pairs of positive integers that multiply to 16. These pairs are potential roots of the polynomial. List all such pairs to ensure no possibilities are missed.\n\n3. **Sum Calculation:** For each pair of roots, calculate the sum to find the corresponding value of \\(k\\). This step requires careful addition to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Average Calculation:** After finding all distinct values of \\(k\\), calculate their average. Ensure that you include all distinct values and correctly apply the average formula, which is the sum of the values divided by the number of values.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations for finding pairs, sums, and the average to ensure accuracy. Small errors in any of these steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
