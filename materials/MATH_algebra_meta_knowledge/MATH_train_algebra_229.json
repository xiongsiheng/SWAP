{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Range:** The range of a function \\( f(x) \\) is the set of all possible values \\( y \\) that \\( f(x) \\) can take. For a quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the range is determined by the vertex of the parabola.\n\n2. **Vertex of a Parabola:** For a quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the vertex \\( (h, k) \\) is given by \\( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \\) and \\( k = f(h) \\). If \\( a > 0 \\), the vertex is the minimum point, and if \\( a < 0 \\), the vertex is the maximum point.\n\n3. **Condition for Inclusion:** To ensure that a specific value \\( y_0 \\) is in the range of \\( f(x) \\), you need to check if there exists an \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = y_0 \\). This translates to solving the equation \\( y_0 = ax^2 + bx + c \\) for \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( f(x) = y_0 \\). The discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\) must be non-negative for real solutions.\n\n5. **Maximizing \\( c \\):** To find the largest value of \\( c \\) such that \\( -2 \\) is in the range, set \\( f(x) = -2 \\) and solve for \\( c \\). Ensure that the discriminant is non-negative to guarantee real solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
