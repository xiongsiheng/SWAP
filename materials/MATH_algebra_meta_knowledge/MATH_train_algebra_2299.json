{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving arithmetic sequences, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Identify the first term (a) and the common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence. In this case, a = 88 and d = -3.\n\n2. **General Term Formula:** Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by \\(a_n = a + (n-1)d\\). This formula helps in finding any term in the sequence.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find when a specific term appears, set the general term formula equal to that term and solve for n. For example, to find when -17 appears, set \\(a_n = -17\\) and solve for n.\n\n4. **Solving for n:** When solving for n, ensure that you correctly handle the arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers.\n\n5. **Interpreting the Result:** The value of n you find represents the position of the term in the sequence. To determine how many terms appear before this term, subtract 1 from n.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by substituting n back into the general term formula to confirm that the nth term is indeed the value you were looking for.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving arithmetic sequences."}
