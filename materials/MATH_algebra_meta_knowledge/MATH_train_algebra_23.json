{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a complex expression involving multiple radicals, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Conjugate Multiplication:** When rationalizing a denominator with multiple radicals, you may need to multiply by a conjugate that involves all terms in the denominator. For example, if the denominator is \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{7}\\), consider using a conjugate like \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} - \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) or a combination that simplifies the expression.\n\n2. **Simplifying Products of Radicals:** Ensure that you correctly simplify products of radicals. For instance, \\(\\sqrt{a}\\cdot\\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{a}\\cdot\\sqrt{a} = a\\). Be cautious with more complex combinations.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After multiplying by the conjugate, combine like terms under the radicals. This step is crucial to simplify the numerator and denominator effectively.\n\n4. **Factoring and Canceling:** Look for common factors in the numerator and denominator that can be canceled to reduce the fraction to its lowest terms. This includes factoring out common radicals or integers.\n\n5. **Verification of Simplest Form:** Ensure that the final form of the fraction is in its simplest radical form and that the fraction is in lowest terms. Double-check that no further simplifications are possible.\n\n6. **Summing Constants:** When summing the constants \\(A, B, C, D, E, F\\) to find the final answer, ensure that each term is correctly identified and added. Mistakes in this step can lead to incorrect final sums.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
