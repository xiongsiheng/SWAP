{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of financial problem involving interest rates and investments, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simple Interest Calculation:** Use the formula for simple interest, \\( I = P \times r \times t \\), where \\( I \\) is the interest, \\( P \\) is the principal amount, \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate, and \\( t \\) is the time in years.\n\n2. **Time Periods:** Ensure that the time period used in the interest calculation matches the period for which the interest rate is given. For example, if the interest rate is annual but the investment period is six months, use \\( t = 0.5 \\).\n\n3. **Sequential Investments:** When dealing with sequential investments, calculate the value of the investment after each period separately. Use the final value to set up an equation to solve for the unknown interest rate.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to the precision of your calculations, especially when dealing with decimals and percentages. Rounding errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the interest rate, verify your solution by recalculating the final investment value using the derived interest rate to ensure it matches the given final value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving financial problems involving interest rates and investments."}
