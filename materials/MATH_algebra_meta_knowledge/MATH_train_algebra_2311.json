{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Lattice Points:** Remember that a lattice point is a point in the plane where both coordinates are integers. This includes both positive and negative integers, as well as zero.\n\n2. **Factorization of the Equation:** Recognize that the equation \\(x^2 - y^2 = 47\\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as \\((x + y)(x - y) = 47\\). This factorization is crucial for finding integer solutions.\n\n3. **Integer Factor Pairs:** Identify all integer factor pairs of 47. Since 47 is a prime number, its only factor pairs are \\((47, 1)\\) and \\((-47, -1)\\). Each pair represents a system of linear equations that can be solved for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n4. **Solving Systems of Equations:** For each factor pair, set up and solve the corresponding system of equations to find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). For example, for the pair \\((47, 1)\\), you would solve \\(x + y = 47\\) and \\(x - y = 1\\).\n\n5. **Checking for Integer Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers. This step is essential to confirm that the points found are indeed lattice points.\n\n6. **Counting Solutions:** Count all distinct lattice points obtained from the different factor pairs. Each valid solution pair \\((x, y)\\) represents a lattice point on the graph.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can systematically find and verify the lattice points on the graph of the given equation, minimizing the chances of errors."}
