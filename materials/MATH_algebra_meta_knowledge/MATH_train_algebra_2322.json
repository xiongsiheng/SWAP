{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for constants in partial fraction decomposition, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Ensure that the denominator on the left side is correctly factored. In this case, \\(x^3 - x^2 - 21x + 45\\) should be factored into \\((x + 5)(x - 3)^2\\).\n\n2. **Matching Coefficients:** When setting up the partial fractions, match the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\(x\\) on both sides of the equation. This method helps in systematically finding the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\n\n3. **Substitution Method:** Use specific values of \\(x\\) (such as the roots of the denominator) to create a system of equations. This can simplify the process of finding \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** After finding the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), substitute them back into the original equation to verify that the decomposition is correct.\n\n5. **Avoid Common Errors:** Common mistakes include incorrect factorization, misapplying the partial fraction rules, or arithmetic errors during the substitution and solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for constants in partial fraction decomposition."}
