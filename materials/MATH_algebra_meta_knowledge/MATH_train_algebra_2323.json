{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand the product. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Identifying Terms with Nonzero Power of \\( y \\):** Focus on identifying and collecting all terms that contain \\( y \\) with a nonzero power. This means terms like \\( 3x \\cdot 4y \\) or \\( 2y \\cdot x \\) should be considered, but not terms like \\( 3x \\cdot 5 \\) where \\( y \\) does not appear.\n\n3. **Summing Coefficients:** Once you have identified the relevant terms, sum their coefficients. Remember that the coefficient of a term includes all constants multiplied by \\( y \\), such as \\( 2y \\) in \\( (3x + 2y + 1) \\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as forgetting to multiply all combinations of terms or incorrectly summing coefficients. Double-check each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Simplification:** After summing the coefficients, simplify the expression if necessary. Ensure that all like terms are combined correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
