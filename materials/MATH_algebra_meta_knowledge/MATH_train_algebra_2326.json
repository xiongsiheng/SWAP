{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Simple Interest:** Simple interest is calculated as \\(I = P \times r \times t\\), where \\(I\\) is the interest, \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(r\\) is the interest rate per period, and \\(t\\) is the time in the same units as the interest rate period.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Create equations for the total amount owed by Darren and Fergie at any given time \\(t\\). For Darren, this would be \\(100 + (100 \times 0.10 \times t)\\), and for Fergie, it would be \\(150 + (150 \times 0.05 \times t)\\).\n\n3. **Equating Amounts:** Set the equations equal to each other to find the time \\(t\\) when both owe the same amount. Solve for \\(t\\) algebraically.\n\n4. **Checking Units:** Ensure that the interest rates and time units are consistent. In this case, since the interest rates are daily, \\(t\\) should be in days.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** After solving for \\(t\\), verify the calculations by substituting \\(t\\) back into both original equations to confirm they yield the same amount.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
