{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly translate the problem into mathematical equations. For instance, if you're given earnings and hours worked, multiply these to find total earnings for each person.\n\n2. **Handling Variables:** Be careful with how you handle variables, especially when they appear in both the number of hours worked and the rate of pay. Ensure that each variable is correctly represented in your equations.\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** When solving for a variable in a linear equation, isolate the variable step by step. Check each step for algebraic accuracy, especially when combining like terms or dividing through by a coefficient.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding a value for \\( t \\), substitute it back into the original conditions to verify that it satisfies all parts of the problem. This step helps catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors made during the solution process.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to details in the problem statement, such as the difference in earnings, to ensure your final equation accurately reflects these conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
