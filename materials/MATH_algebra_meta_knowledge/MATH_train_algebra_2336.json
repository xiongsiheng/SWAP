{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Multiples:** Clearly identify the smallest distinct positive integer multiples of the given number (in this case, 9). These would be 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, and 63.\n\n2. **Sum Calculation:** Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series if applicable. The sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term, \\( l \\) is the last term, and \\( n \\) is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when adding large numbers or using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check the sum by either adding the numbers manually or using a different method to confirm the result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
