{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** Recognize that the problem involves a sequence where each stage adds a fixed number of elements (toothpicks) to the previous stage. In this case, each stage adds three toothpicks.\n\n2. **Understand the Sequence:** The number of toothpicks in each stage forms an arithmetic sequence. The general formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:** Use the arithmetic sequence formula to find the number of toothpicks in the 250th stage. Here, \\(a_1\\) is the number of toothpicks in the first stage, and \\(d\\) is the number of toothpicks added each stage (3).\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for the sequence formula to avoid arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with large numbers.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your result by manually calculating a few stages to ensure the pattern holds and your formula is applied correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
