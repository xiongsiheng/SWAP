{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recall that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is known as the common difference.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given terms to set up equations based on the common difference. For example, the difference between the first and second terms should equal the difference between the second and third terms, and so on.\n\n3. **Solving Systems of Equations:** When you have multiple equations involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), solve them systematically. Use substitution or elimination methods to find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:** Ensure that the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) satisfy all the given terms in the sequence. This step helps verify the correctness of your solution.\n\n5. **Calculating the Fifth Term:** Once you have the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), use the common difference to find the fifth term. Remember to express the answer as a common fraction if required.\n\n6. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Pay close attention to your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and algebraic manipulations, to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
