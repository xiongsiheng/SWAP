{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Inverse proportionality means that as one quantity increases, the other decreases at a rate such that their product remains constant. If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are inversely proportional, then \\( x \times y = k \\) for some constant \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the given information to find the constant \\( k \\). In this case, if 12 customers buy a toaster at $500, then \\( 12 \times 500 = k \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Constant:** Once you have \\( k \\), use it to find the number of customers for the new price. If the new price is $750, then the number of customers \\( x \\) can be found by solving \\( x \times 750 = k \\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you perform multiplication and division accurately to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by ensuring that the product of the number of customers and the price remains constant for both scenarios.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
