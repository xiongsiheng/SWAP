{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving square roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Conjugate Multiplication:** To rationalize the denominator of a fraction like \\(\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}}\\), multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \\(2-\\sqrt{6}\\). This process eliminates the square root in the denominator.\n\n2. **Simplifying Products:** When multiplying expressions involving square roots, use the distributive property and remember that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\). Ensure that the product is simplified correctly.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After multiplication, combine like terms in the numerator and the denominator. This step is crucial to correctly simplifying the expression.\n\n4. **Checking for Common Factors:** After simplifying, check the numerator and the denominator for common factors. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients in the numerator and the denominator is 1, then the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n5. **Ensuring Integer Coefficients:** Ensure that all coefficients (A, B, C, and D) are integers and that B is not divisible by the square of any prime, as specified in the problem.\n\n6. **Summing Coefficients:** Finally, sum the coefficients A, B, C, and D to find the required value. This step should be straightforward if all previous steps are done correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
