{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Recall that if \\(a\\) is inversely proportional to \\(b\\), then \\(a \\cdot b = k\\) for some constant \\(k\\). This means that the product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remains constant regardless of the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Using Ratios:** Given that \\(\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2}{3}\\), use the property of inverse proportionality to relate \\(a_1 \\cdot b_1\\) and \\(a_2 \\cdot b_2\\). Since \\(a_1 \\cdot b_1 = a_2 \\cdot b_2 = k\\), you can express \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) in terms of \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** When dealing with ratios, ensure that you correctly manipulate the fractions. For instance, if \\(\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2}{3}\\), then \\(\frac{b_1}{b_2}\\) should be the reciprocal of \\(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with reciprocals and products, to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that your final answer is consistent with the given conditions of inverse proportionality. Substituting back to verify that \\(a_1 \\cdot b_1 = a_2 \\cdot b_2\\) can help confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
