{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the new operation. In this case, \\(a \text{ Y } b = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\). Recognize that this expression is actually a form of \\((a - b)^2\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Accurately substitute the given values into the defined operation. Ensure that each instance of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is replaced correctly.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform arithmetic operations carefully. Pay special attention to signs and order of operations, especially when dealing with subtraction and multiplication.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the expression step by step. For example, in this problem, after substitution, simplify \\((3 - 2)^2\\) to \\(1^2 = 1\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your result by expanding and checking if it matches the original definition of the operation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
