{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Identify the relationships given in the problem and translate them into a system of equations. In this case, you have $A+3 = B-3 = C \times 3 = D \\div 3$ and $A + B + C + D = 64$.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Use substitution to express all variables in terms of one variable. This simplifies the system and makes it easier to solve.\n\n3. **Checking Constraints:** Ensure that all integers involved are positive, as specified in the problem. This constraint can help you avoid incorrect solutions that do not meet the problem's conditions.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with multiplication and division, as these can lead to errors if not performed carefully.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the values of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, verify that they satisfy all the original conditions of the problem, including the sum and the given equalities.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
