{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution for Simplification:** Consider substituting a variable for a complex expression to simplify the equation. For example, let \\( y = \frac{4x-16}{3x-4} \\), then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + y = 12 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When you have a quadratic equation like \\( y^2 + y - 12 = 0 \\), use the quadratic formula \\( y = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) or factorize it if possible.\n\n3. **Domain Considerations:** Be aware of the domain of the original expression \\( \frac{4x-16}{3x-4} \\). The denominator cannot be zero, so \\( 3x - 4 \neq 0 \\), which implies \\( x \neq \frac{4}{3} \\).\n\n4. **Back-Substitution:** After solving for \\( y \\), substitute back to solve for \\( x \\). Ensure that the solutions for \\( x \\) do not violate the domain restrictions.\n\n5. **Maximizing Values:** To find the greatest possible value of \\( x \\), evaluate all valid solutions for \\( x \\) and select the maximum value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
