{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the compound interest formula \\(A = P(1 + r)^n\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(n\\) years, \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal), and \\(n\\) is the number of years the money is invested.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the total amount invested and the total amount after interest. Let \\(x\\) be the amount invested at the Pretty Penny Bank and \\(y\\) be the amount invested at the Five and Dime Bank. You have \\(x + y = 1000\\) and \\(x(1.03)^2 + y(1.05)^2 = 1090.02\\).\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** Solve the system of equations to find the value of \\(x\\). This may involve substitution or elimination methods.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that calculations involving interest rates and exponents are performed accurately to avoid errors in the final answer.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your solution by substituting the values back into the equations to ensure they satisfy both the original conditions and the final total amount.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
