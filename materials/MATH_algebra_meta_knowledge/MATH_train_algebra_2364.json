{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( k \\) in this problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Slope Formula:** Use the slope formula \\( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\) to find the slope of the line between two points. Since the line is straight, the slope between any two points on the line should be the same.\n\n2. **Consistency of Slope:** Calculate the slope using two pairs of points and set the resulting expressions equal to each other since the slope must be consistent across all points on the line.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** When solving for \\( k \\), ensure you correctly manipulate the algebraic equations. This includes proper distribution, cancellation of terms, and solving linear equations.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for any arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Optionally, once you find \\( k \\), you can substitute it back into the points to verify that the slope remains consistent across all points.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving for \\( k \\)."}
