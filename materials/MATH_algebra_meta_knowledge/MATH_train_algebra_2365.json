{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Scale:** Ensure you correctly interpret the scale of the map. The given scale (12 cm represents 72 km) is crucial for converting between map measurements and real-world distances.\n\n2. **Proportional Relationships:** Recognize that the relationship between map distances and real-world distances is proportional. This means you can set up a proportion to solve for unknown distances.\n\n3. **Setting Up Proportions:** When setting up a proportion, align the units correctly. For example, if the left side of the proportion is in centimeters, the right side should be in kilometers.\n\n4. **Cross-Multiplication:** Use cross-multiplication correctly to solve the proportion. This involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and setting the products equal.\n\n5. **Unit Conversion:** Ensure that the final answer is in the correct units (kilometers in this case). Avoid mixing units in your calculations to prevent errors.\n\n6. **Double-Checking Calculations:** After solving, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially in multiplication and division steps.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving map scales and proportional relationships."}
