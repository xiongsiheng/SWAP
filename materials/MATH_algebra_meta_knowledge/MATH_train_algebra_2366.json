{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the number of students knowing the secret grows exponentially. Each day, the number of students doubles.\n\n2. **Geometric Sequence:** Identify that the number of students knowing the secret forms a geometric sequence. The first term (a) is 1 (Jessica), and the common ratio (r) is 2.\n\n3. **Sum of Geometric Sequence:** Use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence: \\( S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \\), where \\( S_n \\) is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:** Set up the equation with the given sum (1023 students) and solve for n, which represents the number of days.\n\n5. **Converting n to Days of the Week:** Once you find n, convert it to the corresponding day of the week, starting from Monday.\n\n6. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when dealing with exponents and sums of geometric sequences, as these can be prone to errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
