{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the slope of a line given in a linear equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form Conversion:** Convert the equation to the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where 'm' represents the slope. This involves solving the equation for 'y'.\n\n2. **Coefficient of x:** In the slope-intercept form, the coefficient of 'x' directly gives the slope of the line.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform arithmetic operations accurately when rearranging the equation to isolate 'y'. Errors in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can lead to incorrect slopes.\n\n4. **Sign Awareness:** Pay attention to the signs of the coefficients. Incorrect handling of signs can result in a slope with the wrong sign.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the slope by substituting values for 'x' and solving for 'y' to see if the line behaves as expected with the calculated slope.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while determining the slope of a line from its equation."}
