{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving floor functions and square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor 3.7 \\rfloor = 3\\).\n\n2. **Approximating Square Roots:** Use known square roots or a calculator to find an approximate value of the square root. For instance, \\(\\sqrt{80}\\) is between \\(\\sqrt{64} = 8\\) and \\(\\sqrt{81} = 9\\).\n\n3. **Intermediate Values:** Determine the exact value or a close approximation of the square root to apply the floor function accurately. For \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), since it is slightly more than 8 but less than 9, \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{80} \\rfloor\\) will be 8.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your calculation by squaring the result of the floor function and ensuring it is less than the original number. For example, \\(8^2 = 64\\) which is less than 80, confirming \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{80} \\rfloor = 8\\).\n\nThese guidelines help ensure accuracy in evaluating expressions involving floor functions and square roots."}
