{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( k \\) in a quadratic equation with one solution, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** A quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) has exactly one solution if and only if its discriminant is zero. The discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) is given by \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). For the equation to have one solution, set \\( \\Delta = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Discriminant:** For the given equation \\( 2x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\), the discriminant is \\( (-5)^2 - 4(2)(k) \\). Set this equal to zero to find \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\( k \\):** Simplify the equation \\( 25 - 8k = 0 \\) to solve for \\( k \\). Ensure that you correctly isolate \\( k \\) and express it as a common fraction if necessary.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic when solving for \\( k \\), as errors in basic calculations can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Understanding the Context:** Remember that a quadratic equation with one solution is also known as a perfect square trinomial. This context can help verify the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( k \\) in such problems."}
