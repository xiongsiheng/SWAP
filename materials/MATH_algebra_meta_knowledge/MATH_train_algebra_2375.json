{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction Method:** When you add or subtract the equations, ensure that you correctly align the terms and perform the operations accurately. For example, adding \\(x - y = 6\\) and \\(x + y = 12\\) will eliminate \\(y\\), leaving you with \\(2x = 18\\).\n\n2. **Solving for Variables:** After combining the equations, solve for the variable by isolating it on one side of the equation. In this case, divide both sides of \\(2x = 18\\) by 2 to get \\(x = 9\\).\n\n3. **Substitution Check:** Once you find the value of \\(x\\), substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \\(y\\) and verify that both equations hold True. This step ensures that your solution is correct and not just a result of arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients, as mistakes in these areas can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) back into both original equations to ensure they are satisfied.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving systems of linear equations."}
