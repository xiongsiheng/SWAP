{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:** Recognize that the problem involves a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous term. Identify the first term (3 paperclips) and the common ratio (2).\n\n2. **Geometric Sequence Formula:** Use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of a geometric sequence, \\(a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(r\\) is the common ratio, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Inequality:** Set up an inequality to find when the number of paperclips exceeds 100. For example, \\(3 \times 2^{(n-1)} > 100\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(n\\):** Solve the inequality for \\(n\\) by isolating \\(n\\). This might involve logarithms or iterative approximation.\n\n5. **Mapping \\(n\\) to Days:** Once you find \\(n\\), map it back to the days of the week, starting from Monday. Remember that \\(n=1\\) corresponds to Monday, \\(n=2\\) to Tuesday, and so on.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the day you identify is indeed the first day when the number of paperclips exceeds 100.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
