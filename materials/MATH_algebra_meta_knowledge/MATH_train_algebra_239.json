{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying expressions involving radicals, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Product Rule for Radicals:** The product rule states that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot b}\\). This rule allows you to combine radicals under a single square root sign.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:** Use prime factorization to break down numbers inside the radicals into their smallest prime factors. This helps in identifying and simplifying any perfect squares.\n\n3. **Simplifying Perfect Squares:** When a factor inside a radical is a perfect square, you can simplify by taking the square root of that factor outside the radical. For example, \\(\\sqrt{4x} = 2\\sqrt{x}\\).\n\n4. **Combining Like Terms:** Ensure that all terms under the radical are multiplied together before simplifying. This includes combining all instances of the variable \\(x\\).\n\n5. **Consistency in Notation:** When expressing your final answer, use consistent and clear notation for radicals, especially when they involve multiple terms or variables.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying radical expressions."}
