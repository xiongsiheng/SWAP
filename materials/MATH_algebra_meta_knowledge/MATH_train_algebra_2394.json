{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Unit Conversion:** Ensure you correctly convert units from yards to feet. Remember that 1 yard equals 3 feet.\n\n2. **Volume Calculation:** Calculate the volume in cubic feet correctly. For example, if you have 5 cubic yards, convert this to cubic feet by multiplying 5 by 3 (for the length) and then cubing the result.\n\n3. **Cost Calculation:** Multiply the volume in cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost. Double-check this multiplication to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Conversions:** Verify your unit conversions to ensure they are accurate, as errors in conversion can significantly affect the final cost.\n\n5. **Final Review:** Review your entire calculation to ensure each step is correct and logically follows from the previous step.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
