{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Properties:** Remember that the absolute value function, \\(|x|\\), always returns a non-negative value. This property is crucial when solving inequalities involving absolute values.\n\n2. **Inequality Manipulation:** When manipulating inequalities, be cautious with operations that might change the direction of the inequality (e.g., multiplying or dividing by a negative number).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(|x|\\):** Isolate \\(|x|\\) on one side of the inequality first. For example, if you have \\(2|x| + 7 < 17\\), subtract 7 from both sides to get \\(2|x| < 10\\), then divide by 2 to get \\(|x| < 5\\).\n\n4. **Interpreting \\(|x| < a\\):** The inequality \\(|x| < a\\) translates to \\(-a < x < a\\). This range helps in finding the least integer value of \\(x\\).\n\n5. **Finding the Least Integer:** Once you have the range for \\(x\\), identify the smallest integer within that range. This step ensures you meet the condition of the inequality while finding the least possible value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving inequalities involving absolute values."}
