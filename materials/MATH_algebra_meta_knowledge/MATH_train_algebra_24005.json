{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\). This is crucial for finding the equidistant point.\n\n2. **Distance Calculation:** Ensure you correctly calculate the vertical distance between two points by subtracting their y-coordinates.\n\n3. **Coordinate Precision:** Be precise with coordinate values, especially when dealing with fractions or decimals, to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Directional Movement:** Understand that 'walking upwards' means moving along the positive y-axis, so you need to find the difference in the y-coordinates between the meeting point and Charlie's location.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your final calculation by ensuring the distance walked is indeed the difference in the y-coordinates of the points involved.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
