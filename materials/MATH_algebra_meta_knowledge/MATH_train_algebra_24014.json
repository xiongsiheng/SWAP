{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Clearing Fractions:** To simplify the equation, you might consider multiplying through by a common denominator to clear the fractions. In this case, multiplying by \\(10x\\) would eliminate the denominators.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** After clearing the fractions, you will likely end up with a quadratic equation. Remember to use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) if factoring is not straightforward.\n\n3. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** When dealing with equations involving fractions or radicals, always check for extraneous solutions by substituting your solutions back into the original equation.\n\n4. **Identifying the Largest Value:** Once you have your solutions, compare them to determine which is the largest. This step is straightforward but crucial for answering the question correctly.\n\n5. **Precision in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail when performing calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and roots, as these can be prone to arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
