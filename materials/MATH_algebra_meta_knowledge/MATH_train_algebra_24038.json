{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** When converting a quadratic expression to the form \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\), completing the square is a crucial step. Ensure that you correctly identify the coefficient of \\(x^2\\), halve the coefficient of \\(x\\), and square it to form the perfect square trinomial.\n\n2. **Correct Algebraic Manipulations:** Pay close attention to algebraic manipulations such as factoring, expanding, and simplifying. Errors in these steps can lead to incorrect values for \\(a\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Identifying \\(a\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\):** Once you have the expression in the form \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\), correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\) from the expression. \\(a\\) is the coefficient of the squared term, \\(h\\) is the value inside the parentheses, and \\(k\\) is the constant term.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions or negative numbers, are performed accurately. Small arithmetic errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\(a\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\), verify by substituting back into the original quadratic expression to ensure the conversion was correct. This step helps catch any errors in the process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
