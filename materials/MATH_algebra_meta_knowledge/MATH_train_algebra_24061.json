{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( k \\) in this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Substitute the coordinates of the given point \\((x, y)\\) into the equation of the line. In this case, substitute \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( y = -3 \\) into the equation \\( 1 - kx = -3y \\).\n\n2. **Simplification:** After substitution, simplify the equation to isolate \\( k \\). Ensure that you correctly handle the signs and operations during simplification.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( k \\):** Solve the simplified equation for \\( k \\) by performing the necessary arithmetic operations. Be meticulous with division and multiplication to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Verification:** Once you find the value of \\( k \\), substitute it back into the original equation along with the point \\((4, -3)\\) to verify that the equation holds True. This step confirms the correctness of your solution.\n\nBy following these steps carefully, you can minimize errors and ensure the accuracy of your solution."}
