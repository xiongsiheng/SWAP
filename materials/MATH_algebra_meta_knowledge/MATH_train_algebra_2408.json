{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating ceiling functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function, denoted by \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\), returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lceil 2.4 \\rceil = 3\\) and \\(\\lceil -2.4 \\rceil = -2\\).\n\n2. **Negative Numbers:** When dealing with negative numbers, remember that the ceiling of a negative number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number. For instance, \\(\\lceil -2.4 \\rceil\\) is \\(-2\\), not \\(-3\\), because \\(-2\\) is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to \\(-2.4\\).\n\n3. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations to ensure that you are correctly applying the ceiling function to the given number.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating ceiling functions."}
