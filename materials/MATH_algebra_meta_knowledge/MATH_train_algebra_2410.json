{"Knowledge": "To determine the degree of the polynomial \\((3x^2 + 11)^{12}\\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Degree in Polynomials:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable within the polynomial. For a polynomial in the form \\((ax^m + b)^n\\), the degree is determined by the product of the exponents of the variable, i.e., \\(m \times n\\).\n\n2. **Applying the Rule:** In this case, the polynomial is \\((3x^2 + 11)^{12}\\). Here, \\(x\\) has an exponent of 2 inside the parentheses, and the entire expression is raised to the 12th power. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is \\(2 \times 12 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the base of the polynomial (inside the parentheses) does not contain any higher degree terms, as this would alter the highest degree term in the expanded polynomial.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the degree of the given polynomial."}
