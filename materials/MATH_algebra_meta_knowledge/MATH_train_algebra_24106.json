{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying expressions involving cube roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:** Break down the number and variables inside the radical into their prime factors to simplify the expression systematically.\n\n2. **Distributing Exponents:** When simplifying a cube root, distribute the exponent of each factor by dividing it by 3. For example, if a factor has an exponent of 6, its exponent outside the cube root would be 6 divided by 3, which equals 2.\n\n3. **Handling Remainders:** If the exponent of a factor is not divisible by 3, the remainder stays inside the radical. For instance, if a factor has an exponent of 5, the exponent outside the radical would be 1 (5 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2, which stays inside).\n\n4. **Summing Exponents:** After determining the exponents of each variable outside the radical, sum these exponents to find the total. This step is crucial to ensure all variables are accounted for and their contributions are correctly aggregated.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify each step of the simplification process, especially the division of exponents and the summing of these values, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and efficiency in simplifying cube roots involving variables."}
