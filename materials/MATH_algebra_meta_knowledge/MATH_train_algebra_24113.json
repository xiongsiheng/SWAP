{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). The nth term of a geometric sequence can be represented as \\(a \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term.\n\n2. **Finding the Common Ratio:** Given the second and fourth terms, you can find the common ratio by dividing the fourth term by the second term. This is because the fourth term is \\(a \\cdot r^3\\) and the second term is \\(a \\cdot r\\), so \\(r^2 = \frac{6}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Calculating the First Term:** Once you have the common ratio, you can set up an equation to find the first term using either the second or fourth term. For example, using the second term, \\(a \\cdot r = 2\\).\n\n4. **Checking Options:** Substitute the possible first terms from the given options into the equation \\(a \\cdot r = 2\\) to see which one satisfies the condition.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that your calculations are accurate, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, as these can lead to errors if not handled carefully.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
