{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions with given values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values for variables accurately. Double-check that you have replaced each variable with the correct value.\n\n2. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Follow the correct order of operations: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This ensures that the expression is evaluated correctly.\n\n3. **Negative Signs:** Be cautious with negative signs, especially when multiplying or adding negative numbers. A common mistake is to overlook the effect of a negative sign on the entire term.\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each step is correct before moving on to the next. This helps in identifying where a mistake might have occurred if the final answer is incorrect.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After calculating the value of the expression, it can be helpful to review the steps to ensure that no arithmetic or substitution errors were made.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating expressions with given values."}
