{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Always follow the correct order of operations when simplifying expressions. This includes performing operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** When dealing with complex fractions, simplify the denominator first before dividing. This often involves finding a common denominator for the fractions within the denominator.\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, especially with fractions. Errors in multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Double-Check Steps:** After simplifying each part of the equation, double-check your steps to ensure that each simplification is correct and follows the rules of arithmetic.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer back into the original equation to confirm that it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to ensure the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
