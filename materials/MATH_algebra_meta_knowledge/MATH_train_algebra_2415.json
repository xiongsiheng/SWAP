{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of linear equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Addition or Subtraction Method:** When you add or subtract the equations, ensure that you correctly align like terms and perform the operations accurately. For example, adding \\(x - y = 12\\) and \\(x + y = 6\\) eliminates \\(y\\) and allows you to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** If you choose to substitute one variable in terms of the other, make sure you correctly express one variable from one equation and substitute it into the other equation.\n\n3. **Double-Check Calculations:** After solving for one variable, substitute its value back into one of the original equations to solve for the other variable. This step helps verify the accuracy of your calculations.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the values you find for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) satisfy both original equations. This will confirm that your solution is correct and not due to a calculation error.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving systems of linear equations."}
