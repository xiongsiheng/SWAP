{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the maximum value of a quadratic function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n2. **Sign of 'a':** Determine whether the quadratic opens upwards or downwards based on the sign of \\( a \\). If \\( a \\) is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum value.\n\n3. **Substitution:** Once you find the x-coordinate of the vertex, substitute it back into the original quadratic function to find the maximum or minimum value.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure accurate calculations during substitution and simplification to avoid numerical errors.\n\n5. **Graphical Check:** Optionally, you can sketch a quick graph of the quadratic to visually confirm the location of the vertex and the direction of opening.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the maximum value of a quadratic function."}
