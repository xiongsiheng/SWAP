{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( g(g(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( g \\) to \\( x \\), and then apply \\( g \\) again to the result. This is known as function composition.\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, ensure that you substitute correctly. For example, if you need to find \\( g(2) \\), substitute \\( 2 \\) into the function \\( g(x) = 2x^2 + 2x - 1 \\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions. This ensures that you perform operations in the correct sequence, which is crucial for complex functions.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with exponents and multiplications, as these can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Results:** After calculating \\( g(2) \\), use this result to find \\( g(g(2)) \\) and double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
