{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:** Recognize that the even positive integers less than 62 form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\(a_1\\) is 2 and the common difference \\(d\\) is 2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms:** Calculate the number of terms \\(n\\) in the sequence by using the formula for the last term \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), setting \\(a_n\\) to the largest even number less than 62 (which is 60), and solving for \\(n\\).\n\n3. **Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:** Use the formula for the sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence: \\(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)\\).\n\n4. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious not to include 62 in the sequence, as the problem specifies integers less than 62. Also, ensure that calculations involving \\(n\\) and the sum formula are done accurately to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your sum by manually adding the even integers less than 62 to confirm the result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
