{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly define the variables involved. For this problem, let \\( N \\) be the four-digit number and \\( n \\) be the three-digit number obtained by removing the leftmost digit of \\( N \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Establish the relationship given in the problem. Here, \\( N = 9n \\). This means that the four-digit number \\( N \\) is nine times the three-digit number \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Range of Values:** Consider the range of possible values for \\( n \\) and \\( N \\). Since \\( n \\) is a three-digit number, \\( 100 \\leq n \\leq 999 \\). Consequently, \\( 900 \\leq N \\leq 8991 \\).\n\n4. **Checking Validity:** Ensure that \\( N \\) remains a four-digit number when calculated from \\( n \\). This involves checking that \\( N \\) does not exceed 9999.\n\n5. **Systematic Approach:** Use a systematic approach to find all valid \\( n \\) values that satisfy the condition. This might involve iterating through possible values of \\( n \\) and calculating \\( N \\), then verifying if \\( N \\) is a valid four-digit number.\n\n6. **Counting Solutions:** Keep track of all valid solutions found during the iteration process to determine the total number of four-digit numbers \\( N \\) that meet the criteria.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
