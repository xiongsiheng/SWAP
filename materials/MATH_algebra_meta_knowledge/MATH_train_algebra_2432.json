{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Relationships:** Recognize that the given equations are interconnected. Solving for one variable will likely require using information from the other equations.\n\n2. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods to combine the equations effectively. For instance, you might express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\) from the first equation and then substitute this into the second equation.\n\n3. **Careful Manipulation of Equations:** When manipulating equations, ensure that each step is logically sound and that you are not inadvertently changing the relationships between the variables.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and exponents, as these are common areas for errors.\n\n5. **Verification of Solutions:** Once you find a value for \\(a\\), verify it by substituting it back into the original equations to ensure that all conditions are satisfied.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
