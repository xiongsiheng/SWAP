{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identifying Forms:** Recognize that the expression \\(\\sqrt{53 + 20\\sqrt{7}}\\) is in the form \\(a + b\\sqrt{c}\\). This implies that \\(53 + 20\\sqrt{7}\\) must be a perfect square of an expression of the form \\((a + b\\sqrt{c})^2\\).\n\n2. **Expanding Perfect Squares:** When expanding \\((a + b\\sqrt{c})^2\\), remember the formula \\((a + b\\sqrt{c})^2 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{c} + b^2c\\). This helps in matching coefficients with the given expression.\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching:** Equate the coefficients of the expanded form to the given expression (\\(53 + 20\\sqrt{7}\\)) to form a system of equations. Solve these equations to find \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n4. **Checking for Perfect Square Factors:** Ensure that \\(c\\) does not have any perfect square factors other than 1, as specified in the problem.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** Once \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are found, verify by substituting back into the form \\(a + b\\sqrt{c}\\) and squaring it to check if it equals \\(53 + 20\\sqrt{7}\\).\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving the problem."}
