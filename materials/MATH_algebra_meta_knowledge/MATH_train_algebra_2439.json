{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Equivalence Relationships:** Understand and correctly interpret the given balance relationships. For example, if 3 green balls balance 6 blue balls, then 1 green ball balances 2 blue balls.\n\n2. **Consistent Units:** Ensure that all conversions and calculations are done using consistent units. For instance, if you convert the weight of green balls to blue balls, maintain this unit for all subsequent calculations.\n\n3. **Systematic Approach:** Break down the problem into smaller parts. Start by converting each type of ball into blue balls, then sum the total number of blue balls required.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying or dividing to convert between different types of balls.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure that your final answer makes logical sense in the context of the problem. For example, if the question asks for the number of blue balls needed to balance a combination of other balls, the answer should be a positive integer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
