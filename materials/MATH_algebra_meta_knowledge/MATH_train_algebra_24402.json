{"Knowledge": "To determine the maximum number of consecutive positive integers that can be added together before the sum exceeds 400, consider the following:\n\n1. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** The sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers can be calculated using the formula \\( S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a = 1 \\) and the common difference \\( d = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Inequality Setup:** To find the maximum \\( n \\) such that the sum does not exceed 400, set up the inequality \\( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\leq 400 \\). Solving this quadratic inequality will give you the maximum \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** To solve \\( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\leq 400 \\), first multiply both sides by 2 to get \\( n(n + 1) \\leq 800 \\). This simplifies to a quadratic inequality \\( n^2 + n - 800 \\leq 0 \\). Solve for \\( n \\) by finding the roots of the equation \\( n^2 + n - 800 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Approximation and Rounding:** Once you find the roots, determine the integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the inequality. Since \\( n \\) must be a positive integer, round down to the nearest whole number if necessary.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the maximum \\( n \\), verify by calculating the sum of the first \\( n \\) integers using the formula and ensuring it does not exceed 400.\n\nThese steps will help you accurately determine the maximum number of consecutive positive integers that can be added together before the sum exceeds 400."}
