{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Fractional Parts:** When dealing with fractions of a whole, ensure that the fractions sum to less than or equal to 1. If they sum to less than 1, the remainder represents another category (e.g., white bows in this case).\n\n2. **Finding the Total:** To find the total number of bows, you need to set up an equation where the sum of the known fractional parts plus the remaining number equals the total. This involves understanding that the sum of the fractions plus the fraction representing the remaining part equals 1.\n\n3. **Calculating Specific Quantities:** Once you have the total number of bows, you can calculate the number of bows in each specific category by multiplying the total by the respective fraction.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying fractions by the total number of items. A small error in these calculations can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the number of green bows, you can verify your solution by checking if the sum of all calculated parts equals the total number of bows.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
