{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the equation of a line and calculating the sum of its slope and y-intercept, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope Formula:** Use the correct formula for the slope \\( m \\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\): \\( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\).\n\n2. **Y-Intercept Calculation:** Once you have the slope \\( m \\), use one of the given points to solve for the y-intercept \\( b \\) in the equation \\( y = mx + b \\).\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure accurate substitution of the coordinates into the equation to find \\( b \\). For example, if using the point \\((0, -4)\\), \\( -4 = m \\cdot 0 + b \\) simplifies directly to \\( b = -4 \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially division and multiplication, which are common in slope and y-intercept calculations.\n\n5. **Final Sum Calculation:** After determining \\( m \\) and \\( b \\), add them together carefully to find \\( m + b \\). Double-check this addition to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the equation of a line and calculating \\( m + b \\)."}
