{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the distances between points in a coordinate plane. The distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Square Roots:** When dealing with expressions involving square roots, simplify them carefully. For example, \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) should be simplified to \\(a\\sqrt{1 + (b/a)^2}\\) if possible.\n\n3. **Integer Coefficients:** Ensure that the coefficients of the square roots are integers. This helps in identifying the values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) correctly.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations and ensure that calculations are done accurately to avoid errors in the final sum \\(m + n\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** If possible, verify the calculations by using a different method or checking against known properties of the Fermat point.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
