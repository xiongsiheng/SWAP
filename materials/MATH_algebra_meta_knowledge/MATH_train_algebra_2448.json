{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of proportion, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Proportions:** Recognize that a proportion like \\(a:b = c:d\\) can be rewritten as \\(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}\\). This conversion is crucial for solving the equation algebraically.\n\n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** When you have a proportion, cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions. This means multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and setting the products equal.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\):** After cross-multiplication, you will typically have a quadratic equation. Solve for \\(x\\) by factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square, depending on the form of the equation.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Once you find potential values for \\(x\\), substitute them back into the original proportion to ensure they satisfy the equation. This step helps verify that the solutions are not extraneous.\n\n5. **Handling Negative Values:** Be aware that \\(x\\) could potentially be negative, especially if the problem involves squares. Check both positive and negative solutions if applicable.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
