{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into a system of equations. In this case, let \\( p \\) be the cost of the pen and \\( i \\) be the cost of the ink refill. You can set up two equations: \\( p + i = 1.10 \\) and \\( p = i + 1 \\).\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** Use the substitution method to solve the system of equations. Substitute \\( p = i + 1 \\) into \\( p + i = 1.10 \\) to solve for \\( i \\), and then use the value of \\( i \\) to find \\( p \\).\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy. Simple mistakes in addition or subtraction can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n4. **Verification:** Once you have the value for \\( p \\), substitute it back into the original equations to verify that both conditions are satisfied.\n\nThese steps will help ensure that you accurately solve the problem and avoid common errors."}
