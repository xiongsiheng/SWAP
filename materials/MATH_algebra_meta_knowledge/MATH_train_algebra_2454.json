{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Work Rates:** Recognize that work rates are inversely proportional to the number of workers. If more people work, the time decreases proportionally.\n\n2. **Setting Up Proportions:** Use proportions to relate the number of workers to the time taken. For example, if 4 people take 6 hours, then 3 people would take a longer time, and you can set up a ratio to find this time.\n\n3. **Calculating Correctly:** Ensure that you perform the arithmetic correctly when solving for the unknown time. Miscalculations can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n4. **Checking Your Answer:** After calculating, verify your answer logically. For instance, if 3 people take more time than 4 people, your answer should reflect this increase in time.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Make sure all units are consistent and correctly applied throughout the problem. This helps avoid errors related to unit conversion or misinterpretation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
