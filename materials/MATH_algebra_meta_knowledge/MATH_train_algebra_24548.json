{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Recall that if two variables are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. This means that \\( a \times b = k \\) for some constant \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given information to set up equations. In this case, you have \\( a + b = 24 \\) and \\( a - b = 6 \\). Solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Add and subtract the equations to isolate \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). For example, adding \\( a + b = 24 \\) and \\( a - b = 6 \\) gives \\( 2a = 30 \\), and subtracting them gives \\( 2b = 18 \\).\n\n4. **Finding the Constant \\( k \\):** Once you have the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), calculate the constant \\( k \\) using \\( k = a \times b \\).\n\n5. **Using the Constant to Find \\( b \\):** When \\( a = 5 \\), use the relationship \\( a \times b = k \\) to find \\( b \\). This involves simple substitution and division.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are correct, especially when dealing with sums, differences, and products of variables.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
