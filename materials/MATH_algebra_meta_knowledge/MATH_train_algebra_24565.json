{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recall that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference, denoted as \\(d\\). The \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Arithmetic Sequences:** The sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula \\(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d)\\). This formula helps in understanding the relationship between the first term \\(a_1\\), the common difference \\(d\\), and the sums provided.\n\n3. **Using Given Sums:** Utilize the given sums to set up equations. For instance, the sum of the first 100 terms and the sum of the next 100 terms can be used to find relationships between \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\).\n\n4. **Setting Up Equations:** From the given information, you can derive two key equations by substituting the sums into the sum formula for arithmetic sequences.\n\n5. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Solve the derived equations simultaneously to find the values of \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\). This step is crucial as it directly leads to the answer \\(a_2 - a_1 = d\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding \\(d\\), verify your solution by checking if it satisfies both given sum conditions. This step ensures that your solution is correct and consistent with the problem's constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
