{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that the problem involves a sequence where each term increases by a constant difference (arithmetic sequence). Identify the first term and the common difference.\n\n2. **Formula for Arithmetic Sequence:** Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Sum of Arithmetic Sequence:** If the total sum is given, you can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: \\(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d)\\), where \\(S_n\\) is the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for the number of lollipops eaten each day to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with additions and multiplications.\n\n5. **Logical Reasoning:** Ensure that your solution logically follows from the given information and that it answers the specific question asked (e.g., number of lollipops eaten on the third day).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
