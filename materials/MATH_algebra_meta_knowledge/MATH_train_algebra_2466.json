{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand what the problem is asking. In this case, it's about the relationship between the square root and cube of a number.\n\n2. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be proficient in algebraic manipulations, such as squaring or cubing expressions, to isolate variables.\n\n3. **Inverse Operations:** Remember that the cube root is the inverse operation of cubing, and the square root is the inverse operation of squaring. Use these operations correctly to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and roots, as these can be prone to arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Once you find a value for \\( x \\), substitute it back into the original problem to verify that it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
