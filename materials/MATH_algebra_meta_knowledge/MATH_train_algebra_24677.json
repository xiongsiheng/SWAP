{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the defined operation \\(a \\Delta b = a^2 - b\\). This will be the basis for all calculations in the problem.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply the operation \\(\\Delta\\) correctly, following the order specified in the problem. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first.\n\n3. **Exponentiation:** Be accurate when calculating exponents. For example, \\(2^4 = 16\\) and \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** After calculating each part of the expression, substitute these values back into the operation and simplify step by step.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify each calculation to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with exponents and the defined operation \\(\\Delta\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
