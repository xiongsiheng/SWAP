{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponent Rules:** Recall the rules for exponents, particularly how to handle fractional exponents. For example, \\(a^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\) means the \\(n\\)-th root of \\(a^m\\).\n\n2. **Combining Exponents:** When you have the same base with different exponents in the numerator and denominator, you can combine them by subtracting the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator.\n\n3. **Simplifying Exponents:** Simplify the resulting exponent by finding a common denominator for the fractional exponents and then subtracting them.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic involved in combining and simplifying exponents, as errors in these calculations can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your answer by substituting it back into the original expression to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
