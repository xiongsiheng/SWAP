{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving systems of linear equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Ensure that you correctly manipulate the equations when solving for one variable in terms of the other. For example, when isolating a variable, make sure to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation.\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting one equation into another, double-check that you have substituted the correct expression and that the substitution is done accurately.\n\n3. **Elimination Method:** If using the elimination method, verify that the coefficients of the variables you are trying to eliminate are indeed opposites or the same, and that you have correctly multiplied or added the equations.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions or large numbers, as these can be prone to calculation errors.\n\n5. **Solution Verification:** Always substitute your final values of \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) back into both original equations to ensure they satisfy both conditions. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving systems of linear equations."}
