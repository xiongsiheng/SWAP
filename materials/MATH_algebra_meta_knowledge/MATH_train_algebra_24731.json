{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Notation:** Ensure you correctly interpret the function notation. For example, \\( g(x) \\) means the function \\( g \\) applied to the variable \\( x \\), and similarly for \\( g(2x) \\).\n\n2. **Handling Cube Roots:** When dealing with cube roots, remember that \\( \\sqrt[3]{a} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{a} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{a} = a \\). This property is crucial when simplifying expressions involving cube roots.\n\n3. **Equating Functions:** When you set \\( g(2x) = 2(g(x)) \\), you are equating two expressions. Simplify both sides to a common form to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Solving Algebraic Equations:** When solving for \\( x \\), ensure you isolate \\( x \\) correctly. This involves careful handling of fractions and cube roots.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
