{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( g(f(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( f \\) to \\( x \\) and then apply \\( g \\) to the result of \\( f(x) \\). Ensure you correctly identify the sequence of function applications.\n\n2. **Solving for \\( x \\):** When given \\( f(x) = 8 \\), solve for \\( x \\) by setting up the equation \\( x^2 - 7x + 18 = 8 \\) and solving it. This might involve factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.\n\n3. **Quadratic Equations:** Be proficient in solving quadratic equations. Remember the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) and check for real solutions.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is given by \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\). This can be useful for quickly finding the sum of solutions without needing to find each root individually.\n\n5. **Substitution and Evaluation:** Once you find the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( f(x) = 8 \\), substitute these values into \\( g(x) \\) to find \\( g(8) \\). Ensure you correctly substitute and evaluate the function \\( g \\).\n\n6. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions or square roots, as these can introduce computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
