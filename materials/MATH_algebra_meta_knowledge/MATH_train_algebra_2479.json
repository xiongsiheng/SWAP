{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Process:** Clearly understand the process described in the problem. In this case, the process involves removing all leaders, doubling the number of regular members, and adding new leaders.\n\n2. **Tracking Changes:** Keep track of how the number of regular members and leaders changes each year. Use a systematic approach, such as creating a table or using a formula, to ensure accuracy.\n\n3. **Initial Conditions:** Pay attention to the initial conditions provided. Here, the initial number of people (15) includes both leaders and regular members.\n\n4. **Consistency in Calculations:** Ensure that the calculations for each year are consistent and correctly applied. For example, if the number of regular members doubles each year, make sure this is reflected accurately in your calculations.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the total number of people after five years, verify your steps to ensure there are no logical or arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
