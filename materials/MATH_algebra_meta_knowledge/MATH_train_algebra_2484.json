{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** For Angela's account, use the compound interest formula: \\(A = P(1 + r)^t\\), where \\(A\\) is the final amount, \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate, and \\(t\\) is the number of years.\n\n2. **Simple Interest Formula:** For Bob's account, use the simple interest formula: \\(A = P(1 + rt)\\), where \\(A\\) is the final amount, \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate, and \\(t\\) is the number of years.\n\n3. **Correct Interest Rates:** Ensure that you use the correct interest rates (6% for Angela and 7% for Bob) and convert them to decimal form (0.06 for Angela and 0.07 for Bob).\n\n4. **Time Period:** Make sure to use the correct time period (20 years) in both calculations.\n\n5. **Rounding:** When calculating the final amounts, round to the nearest dollar as specified in the problem.\n\n6. **Difference Calculation:** After finding the final balances for both Angela and Bob, calculate the positive difference between their balances.\n\n7. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations for both compound and simple interest to ensure accuracy, as errors in interest calculations can significantly affect the final result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
