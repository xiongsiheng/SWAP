{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Recognize that the problem involves finding two integers whose sum is fixed (1998) and whose product is maximized. This is a classic optimization problem.\n\n2. **Symmetry and Equality:** For a given sum, the product of two numbers is maximized when the numbers are as close to each other as possible. This is because the product function (x * (1998 - x)) is symmetric around the midpoint of 1998.\n\n3. **Mathematical Insight:** Use the fact that the product of two numbers x and y, where x + y = 1998, is maximized when x = y. This can be derived from the quadratic function f(x) = x(1998 - x), which reaches its maximum at x = 999.\n\n4. **Verification:** After determining the integers, verify the product calculation to ensure accuracy, as simple arithmetic errors can significantly affect the outcome.\n\n5. **Generalization:** Understand that this principle applies to any sum, not just 1998. The key is to find the pair of numbers that are closest to each other for any given sum to maximize their product.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
