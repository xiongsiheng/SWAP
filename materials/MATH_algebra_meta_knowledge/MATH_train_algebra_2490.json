{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the midpoint and calculating the sum of its coordinates, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by \\( M = \\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \\).\n\n2. **Coordinate Addition:** When adding coordinates, ensure that you are adding the corresponding x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately before dividing by 2.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially division by 2, to avoid rounding errors or mistakes in calculation.\n\n4. **Sum of Midpoint Coordinates:** After finding the midpoint, add the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the midpoint to get the required sum.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations step-by-step to ensure accuracy, as small errors in coordinate addition or division can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
