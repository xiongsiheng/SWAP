{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Slope:** The slope of a line passing through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is calculated using the formula \\(m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). Since both points have the same \\(y\\)-coordinate, the difference \\(y_2 - y_1\\) will be zero, leading to a slope of zero.\n\n2. **Horizontal Line Properties:** A line with a slope of zero is horizontal, meaning it is parallel to the x-axis. For a horizontal line, the \\(y\\)-intercept is simply the \\(y\\)-coordinate of any point on the line.\n\n3. **Sum of Slope and \\(y\\)-Intercept:** Since the slope is zero, adding it to the \\(y\\)-intercept will simply yield the \\(y\\)-intercept itself. Ensure you correctly identify the \\(y\\)-intercept as the common \\(y\\)-coordinate of the points.\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious not to confuse the properties of horizontal and vertical lines. Vertical lines have undefined slopes and no \\(y\\)-intercept.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the slope is indeed zero and that the \\(y\\)-intercept is correctly identified as the common \\(y\\)-coordinate of the points.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
