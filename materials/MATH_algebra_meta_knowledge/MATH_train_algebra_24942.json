{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Proportionality:** Recognize that energy stored between charges is inversely proportional to the distance between them and directly proportional to the product of their charges. This means that if the distance decreases, the energy increases, and vice versa.\n\n2. **Geometry of the Triangle:** In an equilateral triangle, the distance from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side is exactly half the length of a side of the triangle. This is a key geometric property to use when calculating new distances.\n\n3. **Energy Calculation:** Use the formula for the potential energy between two charges, \\( U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the charges, and \\( r \\) is the distance between them. Ensure you correctly update the distances and sum the energies for all pairs of charges.\n\n4. **Consistent Units:** Ensure that all distances and charges are in consistent units to avoid unit conversion errors in the final energy calculation.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the new energy, verify that your steps are logically consistent and that the new configuration logically should store more energy due to the decreased distances between charges.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
