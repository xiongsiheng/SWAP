{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope Formula:** Use the slope formula to determine if the points lie on the same line. The slope between any two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). Ensure that the slopes between pairs of points are equal.\n\n2. **Algebraic Manipulation:** When solving for \\(a\\), ensure that you correctly manipulate algebraic expressions. This includes correctly distributing, combining like terms, and isolating \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with expressions involving \\(a\\), to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Verify that the value of \\(a\\) you find makes all slopes equal. Substitute \\(a\\) back into the coordinates of the points and recalculate the slopes to confirm they are the same.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, plot the points on a graph to visually confirm they lie on the same line, which can help catch errors in your calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
