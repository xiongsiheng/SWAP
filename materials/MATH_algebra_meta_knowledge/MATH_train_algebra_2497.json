{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral. The distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Square Roots:** When calculating distances, simplify square roots correctly. For example, \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) can be simplified to \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n3. **Perimeter Calculation:** The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Ensure you add all four sides correctly.\n\n4. **Identifying Integer Coefficients:** When expressing the perimeter in the form \\(a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{10}\\), identify the integer coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) correctly by matching terms.\n\n5. **Summing Coefficients:** After identifying \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), add them together to find the required sum. Ensure you add the correct values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
