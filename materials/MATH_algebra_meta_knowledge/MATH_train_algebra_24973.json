{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Unit Conversion:** Ensure you correctly convert between square feet and square yards. Remember that 1 square yard equals 9 square feet (since 1 yard equals 3 feet, and 3 feet x 3 feet = 9 square feet).\n\n2. **Area Calculation:** Accurately calculate the area of the rectangular room in square feet by multiplying the length by the width.\n\n3. **Dividing by Conversion Factor:** When converting square feet to square yards, divide the total square footage by 9 (the number of square feet in one square yard).\n\n4. **Rounding:** If the division does not result in a whole number, round up to the nearest whole number if you need full coverage, as partial squares cannot be purchased.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations by converting the final answer back to square feet to ensure it matches the original area in square feet.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
