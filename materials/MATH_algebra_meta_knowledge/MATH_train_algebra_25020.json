{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you substitute the correct coordinates into the formula. Misplacing coordinates can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Order of Subtraction:** The order of subtraction within the formula does not affect the result because the difference is squared. However, maintain consistency to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Square Roots:** When taking the square root of a number, ensure that you are calculating it correctly. Missteps here can lead to incorrect distances.\n\n5. **Simplification:** Simplify the expression inside the square root before taking the square root. This step can help avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** After calculating the distance, double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating distances between points in a coordinate plane."}
