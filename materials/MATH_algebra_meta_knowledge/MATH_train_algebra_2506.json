{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating an infinite geometric series, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the First Term and Common Ratio:** Determine the first term (\\(a\\)) and the common ratio (\\(r\\)) of the series. The first term is the first number in the series, and the common ratio is the factor by which each term is multiplied to get the next term.\n\n2. **Check the Convergence Condition:** Ensure that the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1 (\\(|r| < 1\\)). This is necessary for the series to converge.\n\n3. **Use the Sum Formula:** Apply the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series: \\(S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\). This formula gives the sum of the series if it converges.\n\n4. **Simplify Carefully:** When substituting \\(a\\) and \\(r\\) into the formula, perform the arithmetic carefully to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Your Work:** After calculating the sum, review your steps to ensure that you correctly identified \\(a\\) and \\(r\\), and that you applied the formula accurately.\n\nThese guidelines will help you minimize errors when evaluating infinite geometric series."}
