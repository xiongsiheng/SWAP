{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Frame Area:** The area of the frame is the total area of the frame dimensions minus the area of the picture. This means you need to calculate the area of the frame by subtracting the area of the picture from the total area of the frame dimensions.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given dimensions and the area of the frame to set up equations. For instance, if the dimensions of the frame are \\((2x + 3)\\) and \\((y + 2)\\), the total area of the frame is \\((2x + 3)(y + 2)\\). The area of the picture is \\(xy\\). The difference between these two areas is given as 34 square inches.\n\n3. **Solving for Integers:** Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers greater than one, you need to find integer solutions that satisfy the equation. This might involve testing possible values or using algebraic techniques to isolate variables.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Once you find a solution, verify it by substituting the values back into the original problem to ensure the area calculations are correct and consistent with the given information.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the dimensions and the calculations of areas, as small errors in understanding or calculation can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
