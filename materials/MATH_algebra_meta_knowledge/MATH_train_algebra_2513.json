{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Growth Pattern:** Recognize that the organism's cell count doubles every two days. This is a geometric progression where each term is twice the previous term.\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Doubling Periods:** Determine how many times the cells double over the given period. In this case, since the cells double every two days, you need to calculate the number of two-day intervals within the 8-day period.\n\n3. **Using Exponential Growth Formula:** If you use a formula, ensure it correctly models the doubling process. The formula for geometric progression is \\( N = N_0 \times r^n \\), where \\( N \\) is the final number of cells, \\( N_0 \\) is the initial number of cells, \\( r \\) is the common ratio (2 in this case), and \\( n \\) is the number of doubling periods.\n\n4. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Pay close attention to the calculations, especially when raising numbers to powers, as these can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by manually calculating the cell count for each two-day period to ensure consistency with your formula-based solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
