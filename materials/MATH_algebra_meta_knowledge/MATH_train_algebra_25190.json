{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Ensure you clearly understand the task, which is to place each of the digits 6, 7, 8, and 9 in exactly one square to make the smallest possible product.\n\n2. **Permutations and Combinations:** Consider all possible permutations of the digits to find the arrangement that yields the smallest product. Use combinatorial thinking to systematically explore all options.\n\n3. **Multiplication Basics:** Remember the basic principles of multiplication, especially how the order of multiplication affects the product. Smaller numbers should ideally be placed in positions that have a greater impact on the final product.\n\n4. **Trial and Error:** Use a systematic approach to try different combinations and keep track of the products. This will help in identifying the smallest product without missing any potential combinations.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a potential smallest product, verify it by ensuring all digits are used exactly once and that no other combination yields a smaller product. This step ensures accuracy and completeness in your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
