{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Area Calculation:** The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Ensure you correctly identify and multiply the side lengths of both the large rectangle and the hole.\n\n2. **Polynomial Multiplication:** When multiplying polynomials, use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to ensure each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. This helps avoid missing any terms.\n\n3. **Simplifying Polynomials:** After multiplying, combine like terms to simplify the polynomial. This step is crucial to ensure the polynomial is in its simplest form.\n\n4. **Subtracting Polynomials:** When subtracting the area of the hole from the area of the large rectangle, distribute the negative sign correctly across all terms of the polynomial representing the hole's area. This prevents errors in sign.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After obtaining the final polynomial, review the calculations to ensure all steps were performed correctly, especially focusing on the multiplication and subtraction of polynomials.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
