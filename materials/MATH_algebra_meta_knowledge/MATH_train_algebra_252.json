{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rational Functions:** Recognize that the given equation is a rational function, which means it involves fractions with polynomials in the numerator and the denominator. Understanding the properties of rational functions is crucial.\n\n2. **Identifying Points of Discontinuity:** Note the values of \\(x\\) that are excluded (in this case, \\(x = -5\\), \\(x = 0\\), and \\(x = 4\\)). These are points where the denominator would be zero, causing the function to be undefined.\n\n3. **Equating Numerators:** To solve for the constants \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator \\(x^3 + x^2 - 20x\\). This will eliminate the fractions and allow you to equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\(x\\) on both sides.\n\n4. **Coefficient Matching:** Once you have a single polynomial on each side, match the coefficients of \\(x^2\\), \\(x\\), and the constant term on both sides. This will give you a system of equations that you can solve for \\(G\\) and \\(H\\).\n\n5. **Solving Linear Equations:** Solve the resulting system of linear equations carefully to find the values of \\(G\\) and \\(H\\). Ensure that you perform arithmetic correctly and check your solutions.\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), you can verify your solution by substituting them back into the original equation and ensuring that the equation holds for all values of \\(x\\) except the excluded ones.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
