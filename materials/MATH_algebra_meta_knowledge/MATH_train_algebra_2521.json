{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Roots and Coefficients:** Recall the relationships between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation. For an equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is \\(-b/a\\) and the product of the roots is \\(c/a\\).\n\n2. **Relating Two Equations:** When given that the roots of one quadratic equation are related to the roots of another, express this relationship mathematically. For instance, if the roots of \\(x^2 + mx + n = 0\\) are twice those of \\(x^2 + px + m = 0\\), denote the roots of the second equation as \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\), and the roots of the first equation as \\(2r_1\\) and \\(2r_2\\).\n\n3. **Using Algebraic Manipulation:** Use the relationships derived from the roots to set up equations involving \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\). For example, if the roots of the first equation are \\(2r_1\\) and \\(2r_2\\), then the sum of the roots is \\(2(r_1 + r_2)\\) and the product is \\(4r_1r_2\\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Zero Division:** Since none of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\) is zero, ensure that your calculations do not inadvertently lead to division by zero.\n\n5. **Simplifying Ratios:** When finding the ratio \\(n/p\\), simplify the expressions carefully to ensure accuracy. This involves substituting the relationships between the coefficients into the ratio and simplifying step by step.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
