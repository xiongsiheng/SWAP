{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Quadratic Forms:** Recognize that the given quadratic form \\(2(x - 4)^2 + 8\\) is in vertex form, where the vertex is at \\((4, 8)\\). This form helps identify the transformations applied to the quadratic.\n\n2. **Scaling Quadratics:** When multiplying a quadratic by a scalar, such as \\(3\\), the vertex form changes but the vertex \\((h, k)\\) remains the same. The new form will be \\(n(x - h)^2 + k\\), where \\(n\\) is the scalar multiple.\n\n3. **Identifying Vertex Coordinates:** In the vertex form \\((x - h)^2 + k\\), the value of \\(h\\) directly gives the x-coordinate of the vertex. Since scaling does not affect the vertex's position, \\(h\\) remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the transformations applied (scaling and shifting) are consistent with the original quadratic's vertex. This helps in verifying the correctness of the value of \\(h\\).\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** Substitute the identified value of \\(h\\) back into the transformed quadratic to ensure it aligns with the original quadratic's transformations. This step confirms the accuracy of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
