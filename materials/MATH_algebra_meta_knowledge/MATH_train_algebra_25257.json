{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Always start by identifying any common factors that all terms in the expression share. For example, in $9x^2 + 3x$, both terms share a factor of $3x$.\n\n2. **Perfect Squares and Cubes:** Be aware of common algebraic identities such as perfect squares and cubes, as these can simplify the factoring process.\n\n3. **Grouping for Quadratics:** If you encounter a quadratic expression that doesn't immediately factor, consider using the grouping method or the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Check Each Step:** After each step of factoring, ensure that the expression remains equivalent to the original. This helps catch errors in distribution or simplification.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After completing the factoring, expand the factored form to verify it matches the original expression. This step confirms the accuracy of your factorization.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in factoring algebraic expressions."}
