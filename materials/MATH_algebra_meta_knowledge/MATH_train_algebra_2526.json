{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perpendicular Lines:** Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. For a line in the form \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\), the slope \\(m\\) is given by \\(-\frac{A}{B}\\).\n\n2. **Calculating Slopes:** Identify and calculate the slopes of both lines. For the line \\(2y + x + 3 = 0\\), the slope is \\(-\frac{1}{2}\\). For the line \\(3y + ax + 2 = 0\\), the slope is \\(-\frac{a}{3}\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the condition for perpendicularity, which is \\(m_1 \times m_2 = -1\\), to set up an equation involving \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(a\\):** Solve the resulting equation carefully, ensuring that you correctly isolate \\(a\\) and perform all algebraic operations accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by substituting \\(a\\) back into the equations to confirm that the lines are indeed perpendicular.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving this type of problem."}
