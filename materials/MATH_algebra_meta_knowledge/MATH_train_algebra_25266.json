{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Series:** A geometric series is of the form \\(a + ar + ar^2 + \\cdots\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by \\(S = \frac{a}{1-r}\\) if \\(|r| < 1\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Subseries:** For a geometric series, the sum of terms involving odd powers of \\(r\\) (i.e., \\(ar + ar^3 + ar^5 + \\cdots\\)) can be expressed as another geometric series with the first term \\(ar\\) and the common ratio \\(r^2\\). The sum of this subseries is \\(\frac{ar}{1-r^2}\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given sums to set up equations. For the full series, use \\(S = \frac{a}{1-r} = 12\\), and for the odd-powered terms, use \\(\frac{ar}{1-r^2} = 5\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(r\\):** Express \\(a\\) from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to solve for \\(r\\). Ensure you correctly handle the algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\(r\\), substitute it back into the original equations to verify that both conditions are satisfied. This step helps catch any algebraic or computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
