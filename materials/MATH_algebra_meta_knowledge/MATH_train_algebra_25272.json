{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection of two lines, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When solving for the intersection of two lines, you need to solve the system of equations simultaneously. Ensure you correctly isolate variables and substitute accurately.\n\n2. **Checking for Parallel Lines:** Before solving, quickly check if the lines are parallel by comparing their slopes. If they are parallel (same slope), they do not intersect.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions or decimals, as these can lead to calculation errors.\n\n4. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use either substitution or elimination methods carefully. For substitution, ensure you substitute the correct expression into the other equation. For elimination, ensure you multiply equations correctly to align coefficients.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the intersection point, substitute the coordinates back into both original equations to verify they satisfy both equations. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the intersection of lines."}
