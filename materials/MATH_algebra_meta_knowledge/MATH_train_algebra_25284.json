{"Knowledge": "To solve this problem effectively, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:** Recognize that the pattern of distribution involves Pete giving himself an increasing number of coins (1, 2, 3, ..., x) and Paul's pile matching Pete's current contribution each time. This means Paul's total coins at any stage are the sum of the first x natural numbers.\n\n2. **Sum of Natural Numbers:** The sum of the first x natural numbers is given by the formula \\(S = \\frac{x(x + 1)}{2}\\). This formula is crucial for calculating Paul's total coins.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Pete's and Paul's Coins:** Given that Pete has four times as many coins as Paul, you can set up an equation relating Pete's total coins to Paul's total coins using the sum formula.\n\n4. **Solving the Equation:** Use algebraic techniques to solve for x, the number of steps in the distribution process. This will give you the total number of coins Paul has, and by extension, the total number of coins Pete has.\n\n5. **Total Coins Calculation:** Once you have the individual totals for Pete and Paul, add them together to find the total number of coins distributed.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can systematically approach and solve the problem with reduced likelihood of errors."}
