{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving quadratic equations by completing the square, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form to Vertex Form:** Understand the process of converting a quadratic equation from the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to the vertex form \\((ax + b)^2 = c\\). This involves creating a perfect square trinomial.\n\n2. **Perfect Square Trinomial:** Recognize that a perfect square trinomial takes the form \\((ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2\\). Ensure that the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is a perfect square, and adjust the equation accordingly.\n\n3. **Coefficient of \\(x\\):** When completing the square, the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the perfect square trinomial is \\(2ab\\). This helps in determining the correct values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n4. **Constant Term:** The constant term in the perfect square trinomial is \\(b^2\\). This should match the constant term in the original equation after adjusting for the difference.\n\n5. **Verification:** After rewriting the equation in the vertex form, verify that the new equation is equivalent to the original by expanding and comparing coefficients.\n\n6. **Sum of Coefficients:** Once the equation is in the form \\((ax + b)^2 = c\\), sum the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to find the required result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations by completing the square."}
