{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the constant term \\( c \\) in the equation of a parabola \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Parabola:** Recognize that the vertex form of a parabola is \\( x = a(y - k)^2 + h \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex. This form can help identify the constant term \\( c \\) if the vertex is known.\n\n2. **Intersection with the y-axis:** The constant term \\( c \\) represents the x-intercept when \\( y = 0 \\). Thus, if the parabola intersects the y-axis, \\( c \\) is the x-coordinate of this intersection point.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation:** Analyze the graph to find key points such as the vertex and intersections with the axes. This can provide direct or indirect information about \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** Use known points from the graph to substitute into the equation and solve for \\( c \\). Always verify the value of \\( c \\) by checking if it fits the given graph.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the scale and units of the graph, as misreading coordinates can lead to incorrect values for \\( c \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( c \\) in the given problem."}
