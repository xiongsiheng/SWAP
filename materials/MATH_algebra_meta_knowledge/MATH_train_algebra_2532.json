{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Ensure you correctly interpret the problem's requirements. Here, Lisa needs to distribute marbles such that each friend gets at least one marble and no two friends receive the same number of marbles.\n\n2. **Counting Distinct Values:** To find the minimum number of marbles needed, calculate the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers, where \\( n \\) is the number of friends. This sum represents the minimum number of distinct marbles required.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Sum:** Use the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers, which is \\( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). For \\( n = 10 \\) friends, this sum is \\( \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating Additional Marbles:** Subtract the number of marbles Lisa already has from the total required to find the additional marbles needed.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with sums and differences.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
