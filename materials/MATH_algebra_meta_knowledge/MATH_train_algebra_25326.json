{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify Variables:** Clearly define the variables you need to find. In this case, let \\( t \\) be the number of tables.\n\n2. **Formulate Equations:** Use the given information to create an equation. Here, the total number of legs from tables and stools is given.\n\n3. **Calculate Legs:** Understand how to calculate the total number of legs contributed by tables and stools. Each table has 4 legs and 6 stools, each with 3 legs, so each table contributes \\( 4 + 6 \times 3 \\) legs.\n\n4. **Set Up the Equation:** Use the total leg count to set up an equation involving \\( t \\). For example, \\( 4t + 6 \times 3t = 484 \\).\n\n5. **Solve for \\( t \\):** Solve the equation step by step, ensuring you follow the correct order of operations.\n\n6. **Check Your Answer:** Verify your solution by substituting \\( t \\) back into the context of the problem to ensure the total leg count matches the given information.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
