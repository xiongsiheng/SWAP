{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of the function \\( w(x) = \\sqrt{x-2} + \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Square Root Function Domain:** For \\(\\sqrt{x-2}\\) to be defined, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. Therefore, \\(x - 2 \\geq 0\\), which simplifies to \\(x \\geq 2\\).\n\n2. **Cube Root Function Domain:** The cube root function \\(\\sqrt[3]{x-3}\\) is defined for all real numbers, meaning there are no restrictions on \\(x\\) from this part of the function.\n\n3. **Combining Domains:** Since the cube root part of the function imposes no restrictions, the domain of \\(w(x)\\) is solely determined by the square root part. Thus, the domain is \\(x \\geq 2\\), which in interval notation is \\([2, \\infty)\\).\n\nBy understanding these aspects of the function, you can accurately determine its domain."}
