{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Proportionality:** Direct proportionality means that as one quantity increases, the other quantity increases at the same rate. If the price of a bouquet is directly proportional to the number of roses, then the ratio of cost to number of roses is constant.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Proportion:** Use the given information to set up a proportion. For example, if 12 roses cost $20, then the cost per rose is $20/12. This can be used to find the cost of any number of roses.\n\n3. **Calculating the Cost:** Multiply the cost per rose by the number of roses in the new bouquet to find the total cost. Ensure that you perform the division and multiplication accurately to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and decimals, to ensure the accuracy of your final answer.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your answer by checking if the cost per rose remains consistent across different quantities of roses.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
