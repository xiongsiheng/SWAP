{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying algebraic expressions like this one, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly by multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the term outside. For example, in \\(2a(2a^2 + a)\\), you need to multiply \\(2a\\) by both \\(2a^2\\) and \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After distributing, combine like terms. Terms are like if they have the same variable raised to the same power. For instance, \\(4a^3\\) and \\(2a^3\\) are like terms.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), ensuring that you perform multiplication before subtraction.\n\n4. **Careful Subtraction:** When subtracting terms, especially those involving powers of variables, ensure you subtract the entire term correctly. For example, subtracting \\(a^2\\) from another \\(a^2\\) term should result in zero.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After simplifying, double-check your work by expanding your simplified expression back to its original form to ensure consistency.\n\nThese steps will help you avoid common pitfalls and ensure accuracy in simplifying algebraic expressions."}
