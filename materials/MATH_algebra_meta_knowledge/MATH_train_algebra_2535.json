{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring polynomials like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Always start by identifying any common factors in all terms of the polynomial. For example, in $46x^3 - 115x^7$, both coefficients (46 and 115) are divisible by 23, and both terms have $x$ raised to different powers.\n\n2. **Factor Out Common Terms:** Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from all terms. This includes both the numerical factor and the variable factor with the smallest exponent.\n\n3. **Check for Perfect Squares or Cubes:** If the polynomial involves terms that are perfect squares or cubes, consider whether the polynomial can be factored using special formulas like the difference of squares ($a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$) or the difference of cubes ($a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$).\n\n4. **Verify Factoring:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure that you get the original polynomial. This step helps verify that your factoring is correct.\n\n5. **Simplify Remaining Expressions:** If factoring results in simpler expressions, simplify them further if possible. For example, if you factor out $x^3$ and get an expression like $x^4 - 5x^2$, simplify it to $x^2(x^2 - 5)$.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in factoring polynomials."}
