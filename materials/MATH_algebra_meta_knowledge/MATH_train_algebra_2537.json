{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Use the substitution method when one variable is expressed in terms of another. In this case, since \\(a\\) is two less than \\(b\\), you can express \\(a\\) as \\(a = b - 2\\) and substitute this into the first equation.\n\n2. **Solving Linear Equations:** Ensure you correctly solve linear equations by isolating the variable. For example, when solving for \\(b\\) in the equation \\(5(b - 2) + 2b = 0\\), distribute the 5, combine like terms, and then solve for \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic calculations, especially when distributing and combining terms, as these steps are prone to errors.\n\n4. **Substitute Back:** Once you find the value of \\(b\\), substitute it back into the expression \\(a = b - 2\\) to find \\(a\\) and verify consistency with the original equations.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:** After determining \\(b\\), calculate \\(7b\\) directly, ensuring no mistakes in multiplication.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors while solving this type of problem."}
