{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the domain of a real-valued function involving square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Non-Negativity Condition:** For a function involving a square root, such as \\(\\sqrt{g(x)}\\), the expression inside the square root, \\(g(x)\\), must be non-negative. This means solving the inequality \\(g(x) \\geq 0\\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** When \\(g(x)\\) is a quadratic expression, solve the inequality by finding the roots of the quadratic equation \\(g(x) = 0\\) and determining where the quadratic expression is non-negative. This typically involves identifying intervals based on the sign of the quadratic expression between its roots.\n\n3. **Factoring Quadratics:** Factor the quadratic expression to simplify solving the inequality. For example, if \\(-10x^2 - 11x + 6\\) can be factored into \\((ax + b)(cx + d)\\), use this factorization to determine the intervals where the product is non-negative.\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** Express the domain in interval notation, ensuring that the endpoints of the intervals are included or excluded based on whether the quadratic expression equals zero at those points.\n\n5. **Exact Fractions:** When giving endpoints, always provide them as exact fractions, not as mixed numbers or decimals, to ensure precision in your answer.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the domain of functions involving square roots."}
