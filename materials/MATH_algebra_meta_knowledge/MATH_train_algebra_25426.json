{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recognize that the expression \\(\\left|x - a\\right|\\) represents the distance between \\(x\\) and \\(a\\) on the number line. This understanding helps in interpreting the inequality correctly.\n\n2. **Inequality Manipulation:** When manipulating inequalities, especially involving absolute values, ensure that you maintain the correct direction of the inequality. For example, multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality.\n\n3. **Fraction Operations:** Be meticulous when dealing with fractions. Ensure that you correctly find a common denominator and simplify fractions accurately. This includes converting all terms to have a common denominator before comparing or combining them.\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** When expressing solutions in interval notation, correctly identify the type of interval (open, closed, half-open) based on the inequality signs. Ensure that the endpoints are correctly placed and that the notation accurately reflects the solution set.\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining the solution set, it can be helpful to test a few values within the intervals to confirm that they satisfy the original inequality. This step helps catch any oversights in the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving inequalities involving absolute values and fractions."}
