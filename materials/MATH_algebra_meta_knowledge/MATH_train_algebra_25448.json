{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing the sum of all the roots of a polynomial equation, consider the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Ensure that you factor the equation correctly. Look for common factors that can be factored out, which can simplify the equation.\n\n2. **Use of the Factor Theorem:** Recognize that if a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) has a root \\( r \\), then \\( (x - r) \\) is a factor of \\( P(x) \\). This can help in identifying roots.\n\n3. **Sum of Roots in Quadratics:** For quadratic equations of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots can be directly found using the formula \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as distributing incorrectly or combining like terms improperly.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the roots, verify by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation.\n\nThese guidelines will help in accurately computing the sum of the roots of the given polynomial equation."}
