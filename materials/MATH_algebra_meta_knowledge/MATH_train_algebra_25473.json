{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Calculate Distance:** Use the formula for distance, which is \\(d = rt\\), where \\(d\\) is distance, \\(r\\) is rate (speed), and \\(t\\) is time. Calculate Joann's distance first.\n\n2. **Convert Time:** Ensure that all time measurements are in the same units. For example, convert Joann's time from three and a half hours to a decimal or fraction if necessary.\n\n3. **Set Up Equation:** To find Fran's required speed, set up an equation where Fran's distance equals Joann's distance. Use the formula \\(r = \\frac{d}{t}\\) for Fran.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to calculations, especially when dividing to find the speed, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure that all units are consistent throughout the problem, especially when dealing with time and speed.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
