{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly translate the given information into a system of linear equations. For example, if the cost of pens is represented by 'p' and the cost of pencils is represented by 'q', the first piece of information can be written as 4p + 3q = 224 (converting dollars to cents), and the second as 2p + 5q = 154.\n\n2. **Solving Systems of Equations:** Use appropriate methods such as substitution or elimination to solve the system of equations. Be meticulous in your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of 'p' and 'q', substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions.\n\n4. **Unit Conversions:** Ensure that all monetary values are in the same unit (e.g., cents) before performing calculations to avoid mistakes due to unit discrepancies.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the coefficients and constants in your equations, as small mistakes in these areas can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
