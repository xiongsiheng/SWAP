{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the value of \\( c \\) for parallel lines, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:** Parallel lines have the same slope. Therefore, the slopes of the given lines must be equal.\n\n2. **Identifying Slopes:** For a line in the form \\( y = mx + b \\), the coefficient \\( m \\) represents the slope. In the given equations, the slopes are \\( 8 \\) for the first line and \\( 2c \\) for the second line.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Since the slopes must be equal, set \\( 8 = 2c \\) and solve for \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( c \\):** Perform the necessary arithmetic to isolate \\( c \\). In this case, divide both sides of the equation by 2.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify by substituting the value of \\( c \\) back into the slope of the second line to ensure it matches the slope of the first line.\n\nThese steps ensure accuracy in determining the value of \\( c \\) for parallel lines."}
