{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Recall that the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for the unknown coordinates of the other endpoint. For example, if the midpoint is \\((2, 9)\\) and one endpoint is \\((4, 3)\\), you can set up the equations \\(\\frac{4 + x_2}{2} = 2\\) and \\(\\frac{3 + y_2}{2} = 9\\).\n\n3. **Solving for Coordinates:** Solve each equation separately to find the coordinates of the other endpoint. For instance, solving \\(\\frac{4 + x_2}{2} = 2\\) gives \\(x_2 = 0\\) and solving \\(\\frac{3 + y_2}{2} = 9\\) gives \\(y_2 = 15\\).\n\n4. **Sum of Coordinates:** Once you have the coordinates of the other endpoint, add them together to find the sum. In this case, the sum would be \\(0 + 15 = 15\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the midpoint you calculated from the two endpoints matches the given midpoint. This step helps catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
