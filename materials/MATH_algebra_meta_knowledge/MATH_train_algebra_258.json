{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of logarithmic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Properties:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as \\(\\log_b (a) = c \\Rightarrow b^c = a\\). This property is crucial for converting logarithmic equations into exponential form.\n\n2. **Converting to Exponential Form:** When you encounter a logarithmic equation, convert it to its exponential form to simplify the equation. For example, \\(\\log_{81} (2r-1) = -1/2\\) can be rewritten as \\(81^{-1/2} = 2r-1\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Exponents:** Be careful when simplifying expressions involving exponents. Remember that \\(81^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{81^{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{81}} = \\frac{1}{9}\\).\n\n4. **Solving for the Variable:** After converting to exponential form, solve for the variable (in this case, \\(r\\)) by isolating it on one side of the equation. Ensure that you perform the same operations on both sides of the equation to maintain equality.\n\n5. **Checking the Solution:** Always verify your solution by substituting it back into the original logarithmic equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. This step helps catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving logarithmic equations."}
