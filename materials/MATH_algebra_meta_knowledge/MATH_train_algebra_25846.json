{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Cube Roots:** Recall that the cube root of a number \\( x \\) is denoted as \\( \\sqrt[3]{x} \\) and represents the number whose cube is \\( x \\). For example, \\( \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \\) because \\( 3^3 = 27 \\).\n\n2. **Inequality Analysis:** Translate the problem into an inequality. Here, you need to find numbers \\( n \\) such that \\( \\sqrt[3]{n} < 10 \\). This can be rewritten as \\( n < 10^3 \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Boundary:** Compute \\( 10^3 \\) to determine the upper limit for \\( n \\). This calculation gives \\( 1000 \\), meaning you are looking for numbers less than 1000.\n\n4. **Counting Whole Numbers:** Count all positive whole numbers from 1 to 999 inclusive. This involves simple arithmetic but ensure you count correctly.\n\n5. **Avoiding Off-by-One Errors:** Be cautious with the range of numbers. Since the question asks for numbers less than 1000, 1000 itself is not included in the count.\n\nThese points will help ensure accuracy in determining the number of positive whole numbers with cube roots less than 10."}
