{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating and simplifying expressions involving square roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Product Rule for Square Roots:** Remember that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot b}\\). This rule allows you to combine square roots under a single radical.\n\n2. **Simplifying Radicals:** When simplifying radicals, factor out any perfect squares from the expression under the square root. For example, \\(\\sqrt{18} = \\sqrt{9 \\cdot 2} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n3. **Handling Variables:** When dealing with variables raised to powers under square roots, use the property \\(\\sqrt{a^n} = a^{n/2}\\). For example, \\(\\sqrt{p^4} = p^2\\).\n\n4. **Multiplication of Variables:** When multiplying variables with exponents, add the exponents. For example, \\(p^2 \\cdot p^4 = p^6\\).\n\n5. **Final Simplification:** After combining all terms under a single radical, simplify the expression to its simplest form. Ensure that no further simplification is possible.\n\n6. **Check for Correctness:** Always double-check your final answer to ensure it is in the simplest radical form and that no arithmetic errors were made during the simplification process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
