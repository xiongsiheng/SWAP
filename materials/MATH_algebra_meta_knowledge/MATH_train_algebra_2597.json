{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of logarithmic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Form:** Recall the definition of a logarithm: \\(\\log_{b}a = c\\) means \\(b^c = a\\). This conversion is crucial for solving logarithmic equations.\n\n2. **Handling Negative Exponents:** Be aware of how to handle negative exponents. For example, \\(b^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = 343\\) implies \\(b = 343^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\).\n\n3. **Fractional Exponents:** Understand how to work with fractional exponents correctly. For instance, \\(343^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\) involves finding the cube root of 343 squared, then taking the reciprocal.\n\n4. **Checking Base Validity:** Ensure that the base \\(b\\) is positive and not equal to 1, as these are the valid conditions for a logarithmic base.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the value of \\(b\\), substitute it back into the original logarithmic equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving logarithmic equations."}
