{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Inverse Proportions:** Understand that the number of people and the time taken to complete a task are inversely proportional. If the number of people increases, the time decreases, and vice versa.\n\n2. **Consistent Rate Assumption:** Assume that each person works at the same constant rate. This simplifies calculations and allows you to use the inverse proportion directly.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the formula for inverse proportion: \\( \text{Number of people} \times \text{Time} = \text{Constant} \\). This helps in setting up the correct relationship between the variables.\n\n4. **Calculating the Constant:** Determine the constant by multiplying the initial number of people by the initial time. This constant remains the same regardless of the number of people or time.\n\n5. **Solving for the New Number of People:** Use the constant to find the new number of people needed for the new time. Ensure you correctly divide the constant by the new time to get the correct number of people.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by ensuring that the product of the new number of people and the new time equals the constant. This step helps catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
