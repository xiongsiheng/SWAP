{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inequalities:** Ensure you correctly interpret the inequality \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) < c \\). This inequality must hold True for all \\( x \\) within the specified interval \\( \\left( -\frac{7}{3}, 2 \right) \\).\n\n2. **Finding Boundary Values:** Identify the values of \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) \\) at the boundaries of the interval, i.e., at \\( x = -\frac{7}{3} \\) and \\( x = 2 \\). These values will help determine the maximum value of \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) \\) within the interval.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Inequality:** Since the inequality must hold for the entire interval, \\( c \\) must be greater than the maximum value of \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) \\) within \\( \\left( -\frac{7}{3}, 2 \right) \\).\n\n4. **Calculating Maximum Value:** Use calculus or algebraic methods to find the maximum value of the function \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) \\) within the interval. This involves finding the critical points and evaluating the function at these points.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations for the maximum value and ensure that \\( c \\) is indeed greater than this value to satisfy the inequality for all \\( x \\) in the interval.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in determining the value of \\( c \\)."}
