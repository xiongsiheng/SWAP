{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Definition Understanding:** Clearly understand the definition of the function \\( f(z) \\). Identify the conditions under which \\( f(z) \\) takes different forms (e.g., \\( z^2 \\) for non-real \\( z \\) and \\( -z^2 \\) for real \\( z \\)).\n\n2. **Sequential Application:** Apply the function sequentially, starting from the innermost function application. Ensure you correctly classify each intermediate result as real or non-real to determine the appropriate form of \\( f \\).\n\n3. **Complex Number Operations:** Be proficient in operations involving complex numbers, such as squaring. For example, if \\( z = a + bi \\), then \\( z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi \\).\n\n4. **Verification of Realness:** Accurately determine whether a given complex number is real. A number \\( z \\) is real if and only if its imaginary part is zero.\n\n5. **Consistency in Sign Handling:** When applying \\( f \\) to real numbers, remember to consistently apply the negative sign as specified in the function definition.\n\n6. **Final Substitution Check:** After obtaining the final result, verify that it matches the expected form based on the function's definition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
