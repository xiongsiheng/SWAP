{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** The order in which discounts are applied can significantly affect the final price. Always calculate both scenarios (applying discounts in different orders) to determine the best option.\n\n2. **Percentage Calculations:** When calculating a percentage discount, remember to multiply the original price by the decimal equivalent of the percentage (e.g., 20% is 0.20).\n\n3. **Converting Dollars to Cents:** To express the final answer in cents, multiply the dollar amount by 100, ensuring that you maintain precision throughout your calculations.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when subtracting discounts and calculating percentages, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Comparison of Final Prices:** After calculating the final prices for both discount orders, subtract the lower price from the higher price to determine the savings difference. This step ensures you accurately compare the two approaches.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
