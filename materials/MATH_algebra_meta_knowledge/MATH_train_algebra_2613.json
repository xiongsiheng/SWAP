{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you are dealing with a system of linear equations where each letter represents an unknown variable. Set up equations based on the given word values and known letter values.\n\n2. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve for the unknown variables. Choose the method that simplifies the process and reduces the chance of calculation errors.\n\n3. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the values you derive for each letter are consistent across all given equations. Inconsistent values may indicate a mistake in setting up or solving the equations.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding, subtracting, or multiplying integers. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a value for the unknown letter, verify it by substituting it back into the original equations to ensure it satisfies all conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
