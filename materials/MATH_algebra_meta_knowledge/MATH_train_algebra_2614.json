{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Odd Numbers:** Recognize that the sequence of odd positive integers can be represented as \\(2n - 1\\), where \\(n\\) is a positive integer.\n\n2. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** The sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is \\(n^2\\). This is because the sequence of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers forms an arithmetic series where each term increases by 2.\n\n3. **Verification Using Formula:** To confirm the sum, use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, \\(S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term, \\(l\\) is the last term, and \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when squaring numbers or performing multiplications, to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Practical Example:** For instance, the first 10 odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19. Their sum can be quickly verified by calculating \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
