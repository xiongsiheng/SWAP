{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring and solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Quadratics:** When factoring a quadratic expression like \\(16x^2 - 106x - 105\\), use the method of splitting the middle term or trial and error to find the correct factors. Ensure that the product of the first terms matches the leading coefficient (16 in this case) and the product of the last terms matches the constant term (-105).\n\n2. **Checking Factors:** After determining potential factors, verify that the sum of the cross-products equals the middle term (-106x). This step is crucial to ensure the factors are correct.\n\n3. **Integer Coefficients:** Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, focus on pairs of integers that satisfy the conditions of the quadratic expression.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** Once you have the factors \\((8x + a)(2x + b)\\), substitute these back into the original expression to confirm they are correct. Then, solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and calculate \\(a + 2b\\) carefully to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers or complex expressions, to minimize errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
