{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Linear Equations:** Recognize that you are dealing with a system of linear equations. You can use methods like substitution or elimination to solve for the variables.\n\n2. **Adding and Subtracting Equations:** When adding or subtracting equations, ensure that you correctly align and combine like terms. This step is crucial for eliminating variables.\n\n3. **Checking Consistency:** Before proceeding, check if the system is consistent. If the equations are linearly dependent, you might need to adjust your approach.\n\n4. **Solving for Variables:** Once you have reduced the system to fewer variables, solve for each variable step by step. Double-check your arithmetic during each step.\n\n5. **Substitution:** When substituting back to find the values of the expressions like \\(wx + yz\\), ensure that you substitute the correct values and perform the operations accurately.\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding the values of \\(w\\), \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy all conditions. This step helps catch any errors in the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
