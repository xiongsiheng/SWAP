{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fraction Changes:** When both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are changed by the same amount, the value of the fraction changes. Understanding how this change affects the fraction's value is crucial.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Formulate the problem into an equation based on the given information. In this case, you need to express the new fraction after adding 5 to both the numerator and the denominator, and set it equal to the given value.\n\n3. **Solving Algebraically:** Use algebraic techniques to solve for the unknown. Ensure that you isolate the variable correctly and follow the rules of algebra to avoid mistakes.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, as these are common sources of error.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the found value back into the original context to verify that it satisfies the conditions of the problem. This step ensures that the solution is not only mathematically correct but also contextually accurate.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
