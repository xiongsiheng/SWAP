{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the coordinates into the formula, paying attention to the signs of the coordinates.\n\n3. **Squaring and Adding:** Accurately square the differences \\(x_2 - x_1\\) and \\(y_2 - y_1\\), then add these squares together.\n\n4. **Taking the Square Root:** Finally, take the square root of the sum to find the distance. Ensure that you correctly compute the square root.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Recheck your arithmetic operations, especially when squaring and taking the square root, to avoid common calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating distances between points in a coordinate plane."}
