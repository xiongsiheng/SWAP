{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Always follow the correct order of operations: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Recognize and apply the distributive property of multiplication over addition and subtraction, i.e., \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\).\n\n3. **Squaring Numbers:** When squaring numbers, ensure you calculate the square correctly. For example, \\(8^2 = 64\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify expressions step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for each step to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Be aware of algebraic identities such as the difference of squares, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\), which can simplify calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
