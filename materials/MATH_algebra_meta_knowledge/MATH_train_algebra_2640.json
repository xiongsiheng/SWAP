{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating polynomial expressions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value of \\(a\\) accurately into the polynomial. For mixed numbers like \\(1 \frac{1}{2}\\), convert them to improper fractions (i.e., \\( \frac{3}{2} \\)) before substitution.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when substituting and simplifying. This includes performing multiplication before addition or subtraction within the polynomial.\n\n3. **Simplification Steps:** Keep track of each step of simplification. Multiply each term in the polynomial by the factor outside the parentheses, and then combine like terms carefully.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check each arithmetic operation, especially multiplications and subtractions, as these are common sources of error.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After obtaining the final result, consider re-evaluating the expression from scratch to ensure consistency and catch any potential errors.\n\nThese practices will help minimize errors in evaluating polynomial expressions."}
