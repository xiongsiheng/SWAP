{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Roots of Polynomials:** Recall that if a number is a root of a polynomial, substituting that number into the polynomial should yield zero. This is based on the Factor Theorem.\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting the given root into the polynomial, ensure that you substitute correctly and simplify the expression step by step. Pay close attention to signs and operations.\n\n3. **Solving for the Unknown Coefficient:** After substituting and simplifying, you will have an equation involving the unknown coefficient (in this case, \\( v \\)). Solve this equation carefully, ensuring that you correctly isolate \\( v \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially those involving square roots and fractions, as these are common sources of error.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, once you find the value of \\( v \\), you can verify by substituting the root back into the polynomial with the new \\( v \\) to ensure it evaluates to zero.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
