{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Always follow the correct order of operations: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify each part of the expression separately before combining them. For example, calculate \\(6^2\\) first, then perform the addition or multiplication as indicated.\n\n3. **Understanding Exponents:** Remember that \\(a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\(a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n}\\). Use these rules to simplify the expressions involving exponents.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for each step to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with exponents and divisions.\n\n5. **Difference Calculation:** When finding the positive difference between two numbers, subtract the smaller number from the larger number to ensure the result is positive.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
