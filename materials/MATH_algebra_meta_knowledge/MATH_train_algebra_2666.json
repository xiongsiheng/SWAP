{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) strictly when evaluating expressions, especially when dealing with fractions and nested operations.\n\n2. **Fraction Multiplication:** When multiplying fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together separately. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.\n\n3. **Floor and Ceiling Functions:** Understand the definitions and implications of floor and ceiling functions. The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\), and the ceiling function \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Nested Functions:** Be cautious when dealing with nested floor and ceiling functions. Evaluate the innermost function first and then apply the outer function.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed accurately, as small errors in calculations can significantly affect the final result.\n\n6. **Verification:** After calculating, verify the result by checking the steps and ensuring that each function is applied correctly to the values obtained.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
