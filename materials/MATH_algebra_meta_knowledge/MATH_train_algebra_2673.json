{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the given conditions. For this problem, let the two numbers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). The equations are \\( x + y = 6 \\) and \\( x^2 - y^2 = 12 \\).\n\n2. **Difference of Squares:** Utilize the algebraic identity \\( x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \\). This identity simplifies the second equation.\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute the sum \\( x + y \\) from the first equation into the simplified form of the second equation to solve for \\( x - y \\).\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed correctly, especially when substituting and simplifying expressions.\n\n5. **Verify Solution:** Once you find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), verify that they satisfy both original conditions to ensure the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
