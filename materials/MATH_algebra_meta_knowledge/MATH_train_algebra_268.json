{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating piecewise functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Piece:** Determine which piece of the function to use based on the input value. For example, if the input is 5, check which condition (if any) it satisfies among the given cases.\n\n2. **Substitute Correctly:** Once you identify the correct piece of the function, substitute the input value into the corresponding expression. Ensure you substitute into the right part of the function to avoid using the wrong formula.\n\n3. **Perform Calculations Carefully:** After substitution, perform the necessary arithmetic calculations carefully to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check the Condition:** Verify that the input value indeed meets the condition specified for the chosen piece of the function. This step ensures that you have selected the correct part of the piecewise function to evaluate.\n\n5. **Review the Result:** After obtaining the result, review it to ensure it makes sense within the context of the function's definition and the given conditions.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when dealing with piecewise functions."}
