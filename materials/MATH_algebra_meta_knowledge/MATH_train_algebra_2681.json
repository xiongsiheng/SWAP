{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing the exact value of expressions involving absolute values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. Thus, \\(|x|\\) equals \\(x\\) if \\(x\\) is positive or zero, and \\(-x\\) if \\(x\\) is negative.\n\n2. **Simplifying Nested Absolute Values:** When dealing with nested absolute values, simplify from the innermost expression outward. This helps in correctly applying the definition of absolute value step by step.\n\n3. **Using Properties of Absolute Value:** Utilize properties such as \\(|a| = | -a|\\) and \\(|a| \\geq 0\\) for any real number \\(a\\). These properties can simplify the process of evaluating expressions.\n\n4. **Checking the Sign of Expressions:** Determine the sign of the expressions inside the absolute values to decide whether to take the positive or negative value during simplification.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After simplifying, ensure that the final expression makes sense by considering the context of the problem and the properties of the numbers involved.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving absolute values."}
