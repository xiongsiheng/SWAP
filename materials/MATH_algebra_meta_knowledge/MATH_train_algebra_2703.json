{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Work Rate Calculation:** Calculate the work rate for each person. For example, if Mary can mow the lawn in 4 hours, her work rate is 1/4 of the lawn per hour.\n\n2. **Fractional Work Done:** Determine the fractional part of the lawn that each person mows in a given time. For instance, if Tom works for 2 hours at a rate of 1/5 of the lawn per hour, he mows 2/5 of the lawn.\n\n3. **Subtracting Fractions:** When subtracting fractions, ensure you have a common denominator. This will help accurately determine the remaining part of the lawn.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations for the work rates and the fractions of the lawn mowed to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure that the remaining fraction of the lawn is logically consistent, i.e., it should be a positive fraction less than 1.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
