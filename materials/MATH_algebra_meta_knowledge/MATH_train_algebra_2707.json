{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Intersection:** Recognize that the line \\( x = k \\) intersecting the parabola at exactly one point means the quadratic equation formed by substituting \\( x = k \\) into the parabola's equation has exactly one real solution (discriminant equals zero).\n\n2. **Forming the Quadratic Equation:** Substitute \\( x = k \\) into the equation of the parabola to form a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). For example, if the parabola is \\( x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\), substituting \\( x = k \\) gives \\( k = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\).\n\n3. **Discriminant Analysis:** For the quadratic equation \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\) to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) must be zero. Calculate the discriminant and set it to zero to find \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( k \\):** Solve the resulting equation from setting the discriminant to zero. This will give you the value of \\( k \\) that ensures the line intersects the parabola at exactly one point.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and ensure that the value of \\( k \\) you find indeed makes the discriminant zero, confirming that the line intersects the parabola at exactly one point.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
