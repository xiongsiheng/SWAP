{"Knowledge": "To determine the degree of the resulting polynomial when expanding expressions like these, consider the following:\n\n1. **Degree of a Polynomial:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, the degree of \\(3x^4 + 2x^3 - x + 1\\) is 4.\n\n2. **Degree of a Product:** When multiplying two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. For example, if you multiply a polynomial of degree 3 by a polynomial of degree 2, the resulting polynomial will have a degree of \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n\n3. **Degree of a Power:** When raising a polynomial to a power, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the degree of the original polynomial multiplied by the power. For example, if you raise a polynomial of degree 2 to the power of 3, the resulting polynomial will have a degree of \\(2 \times 3 = 6\\).\n\n4. **Identifying the Highest Degree:** In the given expression, identify the highest degree terms from each part of the multiplication and exponentiation to determine the overall highest degree term.\n\n5. **Simplification Considerations:** While expanding the entire expression might not be necessary to find the degree, focusing on the highest degree terms from each polynomial involved in the multiplication and exponentiation will guide you to the correct degree of the resulting polynomial.\n\nBy applying these principles, you can accurately determine the degree of the resulting polynomial without needing to fully expand the expression."}
