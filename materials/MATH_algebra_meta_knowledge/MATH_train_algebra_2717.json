{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inequalities:** Clearly interpret the inequalities given in the problem. For example, 'at least' translates to '\u2265' and 'no more than' translates to '\u2264'.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem's conditions into mathematical equations or inequalities. Ensure that each condition is accurately represented.\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** When solving for variables in inequalities, be cautious with operations that reverse the inequality sign, such as multiplying or dividing by a negative number.\n\n4. **Minimizing Variables:** Aim to express one variable in terms of the other to simplify the problem. This often involves isolating one variable and substituting it into the other inequality.\n\n5. **Checking Boundaries:** When finding the minimum or maximum values, check the boundaries of the inequalities to ensure you are finding the correct extreme value.\n\n6. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure that the solution satisfies all parts of the problem statement. This includes checking that the solution fits both the lower and upper bounds specified in the inequalities.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
