{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving systems of linear equations, consider the following:\n\n1. **Elimination Method:** When using the elimination method, ensure that you multiply each equation by the correct factor to align the coefficients of one of the variables. This step is crucial to avoid errors in the elimination process.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** If you choose the substitution method, isolate one variable correctly and substitute it into the other equation. Double-check your substitution to ensure accuracy.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding or subtracting equations, as these steps are prone to errors.\n\n4. **Verification:** Always substitute the solution back into both original equations to verify that the ordered pair satisfies both equations. This step will catch any errors in the solving process.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the system is consistent and independent. If the system is inconsistent, there will be no solution, and if it is dependent, there will be infinitely many solutions.\n\nThese guidelines should help minimize mistakes while solving systems of linear equations."}
