{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** When given two conditions involving sums and differences, set up a system of equations. For example, if the integers are \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), you can write \\(x + y = 50\\) and \\(x - y = 12\\).\n\n2. **Solving for Variables:** Solve the system of equations to find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). You can add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the other.\n\n3. **Difference of Squares:** Remember the algebraic identity for the difference of squares: \\(x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)\\). This identity simplifies the calculation of the difference of the squares of the integers.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy. Simple mistakes in addition, subtraction, or multiplication can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:** Once you find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), verify that they satisfy the original conditions (sum and difference of the integers). This step ensures that your solution is correct and consistent with the problem's constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
