{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Forms:** Recognize that \\(3^{2x}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) are both expressions involving powers of 3. Convert \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) to its exponential form, which is \\(3^{3/2}\\), to align both sides of the equation.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When you have the same base on both sides of an equation, you can set the exponents equal to each other. This is based on the property \\(a^m = a^n\\) implies \\(m = n\\) if \\(a > 0\\) and \\(a \neq 1\\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Once you equate the exponents, solve the resulting linear equation for \\(x\\). Ensure you handle fractions correctly during this step.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding \\(x\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to ensure that no mistakes were made during the simplification or solving process.\n\n5. **Expressing Answers Precisely:** When asked to express the answer as a common fraction, ensure that your final answer is in the simplest fractional form.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
