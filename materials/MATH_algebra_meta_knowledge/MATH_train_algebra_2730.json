{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. Thus, |x| = x if x \u2265 0, and |x| = -x if x < 0.\n\n2. **Calculating Squares:** Ensure accurate calculation of squares. For example, 18^2 = 324 and 16^2 = 256.\n\n3. **Finding the Difference:** Subtract the smaller square from the larger square to avoid negative results when finding the difference.\n\n4. **Dividing by Two:** After finding the absolute value of the difference, divide by 2 to get half of that value. Ensure you perform this division correctly to get the final answer.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Always double-check your arithmetic to ensure that each step is performed correctly, as small errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving this type of problem."}
