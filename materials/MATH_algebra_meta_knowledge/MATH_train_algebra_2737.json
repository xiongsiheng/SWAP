{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Common Denominator:** When dealing with fractions, always consider finding a common denominator to simplify the equation. For example, in this problem, you can multiply both sides by \\(12xy\\) to eliminate the fractions.\n\n2. **Symmetric Equations:** Recognize that equations like \\(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{12}\\) are symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This means that if \\((x, y)\\) is a solution, then \\((y, x)\\) is also a solution. This symmetry can help in systematically checking pairs.\n\n3. **Integer Solutions:** Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers, ensure that your solutions are integers. This constraint can help in narrowing down possible values by checking divisibility and factors.\n\n4. **Minimizing the Sum:** To find the smallest possible value for \\(x + y\\), consider starting with smaller integer values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and incrementally checking larger values. This approach helps in quickly identifying the minimum sum.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the given condition. This step is crucial to avoid errors in reasoning or calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
