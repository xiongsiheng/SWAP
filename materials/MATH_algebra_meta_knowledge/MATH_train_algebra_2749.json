{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). Ensure you correctly identify the integer part of \\(x\\) for each value in the given interval.\n\n2. **Prime Number Identification:** Be proficient in identifying prime numbers within the range specified. This is crucial for determining when the first case of the piecewise function applies.\n\n3. **Recursive Definitions:** When dealing with recursive definitions like \\(p(x)\\), understand how to apply the function iteratively. Start by identifying the base cases where \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) is prime, then build up from there using the recursive rule.\n\n4. **Greatest Prime Factor:** For numbers where \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) is not prime, correctly identify the greatest prime factor. This will determine the value of \\(y\\) in the recursive part of the definition.\n\n5. **Interval Notation:** When expressing the range of a function, use correct interval notation, including proper use of parentheses and brackets to indicate whether endpoints are included or excluded.\n\n6. **Verification:** After determining the range, verify by checking key values within the interval to ensure consistency with the function's definition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
