{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Square Root Calculation:** When finding the square root of a number, ensure you correctly identify both the positive and negative roots, as both are valid solutions for square roots of non-negative numbers.\n\n2. **Integer Verification:** Since the problem specifies that \\( x \\) is an integer, verify that your solution for \\( x \\) is indeed an integer.\n\n3. **Difference of Squares:** Use the difference of squares formula, \\( (x+1)(x-1) = x^2 - 1 \\), to simplify the calculation. This formula helps avoid potential errors in multiplication.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when subtracting 1 from \\( x^2 \\), as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Final Check:** Substitute your value for \\( x \\) back into the expression \\( (x+1)(x-1) \\) to verify the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
