{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the operation defined by \\(a \\bowtie b\\). In this case, it involves an infinite nested radical. Recognize that \\(a \\bowtie b\\) can be expressed as \\(a + \\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + ...}}}\\), which simplifies to a known form.\n\n2. **Simplifying Nested Radicals:** For nested radicals of the form \\(\\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + ...}}}\\), recognize that this can be set equal to a variable (say \\(x\\)) and solved as \\(x = \\sqrt{b + x}\\). This leads to a quadratic equation.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When you derive a quadratic equation from the nested radical, solve it using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), and ensure you select the correct root based on the context of the problem.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the value of \\(y\\), substitute it back into the original equation \\(4 \\bowtie y = 10\\) to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to ensure that no errors were made during the simplification or solving process.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the details of the arithmetic and algebraic manipulations, as small errors in these steps can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
