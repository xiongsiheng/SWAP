{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Square Both Sides:** When you square both sides of an equation to eliminate the square root, you might introduce extraneous solutions. Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions:** Ensure that you simplify expressions correctly, especially when dealing with square roots. For example, \\(\\sqrt{2x}\\) is not the same as \\(2\\sqrt{x}\\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When you obtain a quadratic equation after squaring both sides, solve it using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. Be cautious of extraneous solutions that may not satisfy the original equation.\n\n4. **Double-Check Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
