{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of linear equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Elimination Method:** When using the elimination method, multiply equations by appropriate constants so that coefficients of one variable in both equations are the same or opposites. This helps in eliminating one variable.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** Alternatively, solve one equation for one variable in terms of the other, and substitute into the second equation. This can be straightforward but requires careful substitution to avoid errors.\n\n3. **Check for Common Factors:** Before starting, check if the coefficients of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in both equations have common factors. Simplifying by these factors can reduce the complexity of the equations.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing large numbers or fractions, as these can lead to calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) back into both original equations to ensure they satisfy both conditions. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such systems of equations."}
