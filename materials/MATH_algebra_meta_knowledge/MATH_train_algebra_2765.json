{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving nested function applications, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition Order:** When applying nested functions, start from the innermost function and work outward. This ensures that each function is applied correctly to the result of the previous function.\n\n2. **Simplifying Intermediate Steps:** After applying each function, simplify the result immediately. This helps in keeping track of the calculations and reduces the chance of making errors in subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Understanding Function Properties:** Be familiar with the properties of the functions involved. For example, knowing that squaring a number and then taking the square root (or vice versa) can simplify the expression.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After each function application, double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy. Small errors in intermediate steps can lead to incorrect final results.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have the final result, consider verifying it by working through the problem again or using a different method if feasible. This step can catch any systematic errors in your approach.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving nested function applications."}
