{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is given by \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you substitute the correct coordinates into the formula. Misplacing coordinates can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Simplifying Radicals:** After calculating the expression under the square root, simplify the radical to its simplest form. This often involves factoring numbers into their prime components and simplifying square roots of perfect squares.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your arithmetic calculations, especially when squaring numbers and when adding the squared differences. Small errors in these steps can significantly affect the final answer.\n\n5. **Exact Form:** Express your final answer in simplest radical form unless specified otherwise. Avoid rounding or approximating unless explicitly required.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the distance between two points."}
