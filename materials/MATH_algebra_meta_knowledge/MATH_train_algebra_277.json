{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the other endpoint of a line segment given its midpoint and one endpoint, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Recall the midpoint formula, which states that the midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) is given by \\( M\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the midpoint coordinates to set up equations for the unknown endpoint. For example, if the midpoint is \\( (1, -2) \\) and one endpoint is \\( (4, 5) \\), you can set up the equations \\( \frac{4 + x_2}{2} = 1 \\) and \\( \frac{5 + y_2}{2} = -2 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Coordinates:** Solve each equation separately to find the coordinates of the other endpoint. For the x-coordinate, solve \\( \frac{4 + x_2}{2} = 1 \\) to get \\( x_2 = 2 \times 1 - 4 \\). For the y-coordinate, solve \\( \frac{5 + y_2}{2} = -2 \\) to get \\( y_2 = 2 \times -2 - 5 \\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you perform the arithmetic correctly when solving for each coordinate. A common mistake is to miscalculate the subtraction or addition.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have the coordinates of the other endpoint, it's a good practice to verify by calculating the midpoint using both endpoints to confirm it matches the given midpoint.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
