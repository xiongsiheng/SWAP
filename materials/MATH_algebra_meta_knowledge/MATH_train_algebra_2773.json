{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Forms:** Recognize that both sides of the equation involve powers of 2. Specifically, \\(\\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = 2^{-2}\\) and \\(16 = 2^4\\). This insight helps in converting the equation into a simpler form.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When the bases are the same, you can set the exponents equal to each other. This is based on the property \\(a^m = a^n\\) implies \\(m = n\\) if \\(a > 0\\) and \\(a \neq 1\\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** After equating the exponents, you will be dealing with a linear equation in \\(x\\). Solving these involves basic algebraic manipulations like combining like terms and isolating \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify your solution by substituting \\(x\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to catch any errors in algebraic manipulations or in the application of exponent rules.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and values of the exponents, as mistakes in these areas can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
