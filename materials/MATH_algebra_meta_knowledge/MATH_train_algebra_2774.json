{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Look for any common factors in the terms of the expression. In this case, \\((x+2)\\) is a common factor.\n\n2. **Factor by Grouping:** If you can identify common factors across different parts of the expression, factor them out. This often involves grouping terms together that share a common factor.\n\n3. **Simplify Before Factoring:** Simplify the expression if possible before attempting to factor. This can sometimes reveal a simpler structure to factor.\n\n4. **Check Your Factoring:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure that you get the original expression. This step helps verify the correctness of your factoring.\n\n5. **Be Mindful of Signs:** Pay attention to the signs of the terms when factoring. Incorrect handling of signs can lead to incorrect factored forms.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can minimize errors and improve the accuracy of your factoring."}
