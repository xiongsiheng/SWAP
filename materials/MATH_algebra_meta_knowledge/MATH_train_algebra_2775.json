{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation \\(\\clubsuit\\). In this case, \\(a \\clubsuit b = \\frac{2a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{b}{a}\\). Simplify the expression to see if it reduces to a simpler form.\n\n2. **Simplification:** Simplify the operation as much as possible before substituting values. For \\(a \\clubsuit b\\), notice that \\(\\frac{2a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{b}{a} = 2\\), regardless of the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Apply the operation in the correct order, starting from the innermost operation and moving outward. This ensures that each step is calculated correctly before proceeding to the next.\n\n4. **Substitution and Calculation:** When substituting values, double-check that you are using the correct numbers and performing the operations accurately. Small errors in substitution or calculation can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify the steps by performing the operations in reverse or using different values to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
