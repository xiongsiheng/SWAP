{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection of two lines, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Set Equations Equal:** To find the intersection, set the equations of the lines equal to each other since at the intersection point, both \\( y \\) values are the same.\n\n2. **Solve for \\( x \\):** Isolate \\( x \\) by solving the resulting equation. This step involves basic algebraic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3. **Substitute \\( x \\) Back:** Once you have the \\( x \\)-coordinate, substitute it back into either original line equation to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinate.\n\n4. **Express Coordinates as Fractions:** Ensure that both coordinates are expressed as common fractions, simplifying them to their lowest terms if necessary.\n\n5. **Check Both Equations:** Verify that the coordinates you found satisfy both original equations to confirm that they represent the correct intersection point.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in finding the intersection of two lines."}
