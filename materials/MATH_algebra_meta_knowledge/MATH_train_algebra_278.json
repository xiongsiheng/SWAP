{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Fractions:** When dealing with algebraic fractions, simplify the numerator and denominator separately before combining them. This can help avoid errors in the simplification process.\n\n2. **Eliminating Denominators:** If the equation involves fractions, multiply through by the least common denominator to clear the fractions. This step can simplify the equation and make it easier to solve.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When you arrive at a quadratic equation, use the quadratic formula or factoring techniques to find the roots. Ensure that you correctly identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving the equation, check each solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it is not extraneous. This step is crucial when dealing with equations that involve fractions or radicals.\n\n5. **Identifying the Largest Value:** Once you have the solutions, compare them to determine which is the largest. This step is straightforward but important to ensure you answer the question correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
