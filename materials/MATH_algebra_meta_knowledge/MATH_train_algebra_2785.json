{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Variation:** Recall that if two quantities vary inversely, their product is constant. Mathematically, this is expressed as \\(x^2 \\cdot y = k\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Using Given Values:** Utilize the given values to find the constant \\(k\\). In this case, use \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 10\\) to calculate \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Constant:** Once \\(k\\) is determined, use it to find the new value of \\(x\\) when \\(y\\) is 4000. Set up the equation \\(x^2 \\cdot 4000 = k\\) and solve for \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Ensuring Positivity:** Since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are always positive, ensure that your final value for \\(x\\) is positive.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify your calculations by substituting the new values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) back into the inverse variation relationship to confirm that the product remains constant.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
