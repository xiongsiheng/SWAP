{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Proportional Relationships:** Recognize that the cost of candies is directly proportional to the number of candies. This means you can set up a proportion to find the cost for a different number of candies.\n\n2. **Setting Up Proportions:** When setting up a proportion, ensure that the units on both sides of the equation match. For example, if one side compares the cost in dollars to the number of candies, the other side should do the same.\n\n3. **Cross-Multiplication:** When solving the proportion using cross-multiplication, double-check your arithmetic to ensure the correct multiplication and division are performed.\n\n4. **Unit Conversion:** Ensure that all quantities are in the correct units before performing calculations. In this case, both the number of candies and the cost are in their respective units, so no conversion is needed.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the cost, it can be helpful to verify the result by checking if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem. For example, if the cost seems unusually high or low, recheck your calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
