{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Equating to Zero:** To find when an equation has exactly one real solution, set the quadratic equation equal to zero and solve for the discriminant being zero (since a quadratic equation has exactly one real solution if and only if its discriminant is zero).\n\n2. **Expanding and Simplifying:** Ensure that you correctly expand and simplify the given equation. Combine like terms and rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n3. **Discriminant Calculation:** The discriminant of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(b^2 - 4ac\\). For the equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero.\n\n4. **Solving for the Parameter:** After setting the discriminant to zero, solve for the parameter \\(m\\) involved. This might involve algebraic manipulation and ensuring that the solution is in the simplest form.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the value of \\(m\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it indeed results in a quadratic equation with exactly one real solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
