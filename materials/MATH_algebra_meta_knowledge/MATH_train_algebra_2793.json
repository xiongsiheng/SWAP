{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Elimination Method:** When using the elimination method, ensure that you multiply the equations correctly to align the coefficients of one variable so that they can be eliminated. Check your arithmetic carefully during this step.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** If using the substitution method, isolate one variable correctly and substitute it into the other equation without making errors in the substitution process.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to decimal points and rounding during calculations. Errors often occur when dealing with decimal numbers.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** After solving for one variable, substitute its value back into either original equation to solve for the other variable. This step helps verify the accuracy of your solution.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Substitute the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) back into both original equations to ensure they satisfy both equations. This step is crucial to catch any errors made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving systems of linear equations with decimals."}
