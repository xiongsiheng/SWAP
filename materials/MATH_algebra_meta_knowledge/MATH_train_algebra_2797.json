{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Parallel Lines:** Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope. Calculate the slope of segment \\(AB\\) and use it to find the slope of segment \\(XY\\).\n\n2. **Slope Formula:** Remember the slope formula, which is \\(\\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). Apply this formula to both segments \\(AB\\) and \\(XY\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Once you have the slope of \\(AB\\), set up an equation using the coordinates of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) to find \\(k\\). Ensure that the slopes are equal to confirm parallelism.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions, as these can lead to common errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\(k\\), verify that the slopes of both segments \\(AB\\) and \\(XY\\) are indeed equal to ensure your solution is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
