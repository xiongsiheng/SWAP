{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Clearly define variables and set up equations based on the information given. For example, let \\( G \\) represent the number of girls and \\( B \\) represent the number of boys.\n\n2. **Understanding Proportions:** Recognize that half of the girls attended the meeting, which means \\( \frac{G}{2} \\) attended, and all boys attended, which means \\( B \\) attended.\n\n3. **Total Attendance:** Ensure that the sum of the attendees matches the given total. In this case, \\( \frac{G}{2} + B = 16 \\).\n\n4. **Total Members:** Remember that the total number of members is given as 26, so \\( G + B = 26 \\).\n\n5. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Use the two equations to solve for \\( G \\) and \\( B \\). This involves substituting and isolating variables carefully to avoid calculation errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your solution by substituting the values back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy both the attendance and total membership conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
