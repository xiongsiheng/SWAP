{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying algebraic expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Remember to distribute any negative signs or coefficients correctly across all terms inside parentheses.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms, which are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. For example, \\(3x^2\\) and \\(-3x^2\\) are like terms.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying expressions, ensuring that you handle parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing coefficients and constants.\n\n5. **Double-Check Simplified Form:** After simplifying, double-check that all operations have been performed correctly and that the expression is in its simplest form.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying algebraic expressions."}
