{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula for solving for the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), which is \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\).\n\n2. **Sum and Product of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(a + b = -\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the roots \\(ab = \frac{c}{a}\\).\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting the roots back into an expression like \\((2a-3)(4b-6)\\), ensure you substitute correctly and simplify step by step to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for both finding the roots and substituting them into the expression to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Use of Symmetry:** Recognize that the expression \\((2a-3)(4b-6)\\) can be simplified using the properties of the roots of the quadratic equation, exploiting the symmetry between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
