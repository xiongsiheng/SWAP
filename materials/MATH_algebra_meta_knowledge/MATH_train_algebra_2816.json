{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Recall that the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\). This formula is crucial for finding the midpoints of the sides of the triangle.\n\n2. **Sum of Coordinates:** Understand that the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides of a triangle can be derived from the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the vertices. Specifically, if the vertices have \\(x\\)-coordinates \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the midpoints of the sides will have \\(x\\)-coordinates \\(\frac{a+b}{2}\\), \\(\frac{b+c}{2}\\), and \\(\frac{c+a}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be proficient in algebraic manipulation to sum these midpoint coordinates correctly. The sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the midpoints is \\(\frac{a+b}{2} + \frac{b+c}{2} + \frac{c+a}{2}\\), which simplifies to \\(\frac{2(a+b+c)}{2} = a + b + c\\).\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that your final answer is consistent with the given information. In this case, the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the vertices is given as 10, so the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the midpoints should also be 10.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with fractions and sums.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
