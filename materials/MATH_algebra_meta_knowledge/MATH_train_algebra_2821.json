{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding polynomial products, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Organize Terms:** Keep the terms organized by writing down each product of terms as you go, and then combine like terms at the end.\n\n3. **Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms carefully. Like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n4. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as forgetting to multiply a term or incorrectly adding exponents when multiplying variables.\n\n5. **Check Work:** After combining like terms, double-check your work by ensuring all terms have been accounted for and that the arithmetic is correct.\n\nThese strategies will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when expanding polynomial products."}
