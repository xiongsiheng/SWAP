{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation \\(\\star\\). In this case, \\(a \\star b = ab + 2b - a\\). Make sure you apply this definition correctly when substituting values.\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting values into the operation, ensure that you substitute correctly and simplify the resulting equation step by step. Pay close attention to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** After simplifying the equation to a standard linear form (e.g., \\(ax + b = c\\)), use appropriate algebraic techniques to solve for the variable. This typically involves isolating the variable on one side of the equation.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After finding a solution, double-check your calculations by substituting the value of \\(x\\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition.\n\n5. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as incorrect distribution, misplacing signs, or forgetting to multiply or add terms correctly. These can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
