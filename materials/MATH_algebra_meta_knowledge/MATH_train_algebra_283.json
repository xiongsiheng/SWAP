{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection point of two lines, consider the following:\n\n1. **Slope of Perpendicular Lines:** Remember that the slope of a line perpendicular to another is the negative reciprocal of the original line's slope. For example, if a line has a slope of \\(2\\), the slope of a line perpendicular to it is \\(-\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Equation of a Line:** Use the point-slope form of a line equation, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line, to find the equation of the perpendicular line.\n\n3. **Solving Systems of Equations:** Set the equations of the two lines equal to each other to find the intersection point. Solve for \\(x\\) first, then substitute the value of \\(x\\) into one of the original equations to find \\(y\\).\n\n4. **Checking Your Work:** After finding the intersection point, substitute both coordinates back into both original equations to verify that they satisfy both equations.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and calculations, as errors in these areas can lead to incorrect intersection points.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving such problems."}
