{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Series:** Recognize that the distances Kevin Kangaroo hops form a geometric series, where each term is a fraction of the previous term. The common ratio in this series is \\(\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Geometric Series:** The sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula \\(S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Fraction Operations:** Be precise when performing operations with fractions, especially when multiplying and dividing fractions. Simplify each step to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Termination of Series:** Understand that the series does not end after a finite number of terms; it approaches but never reaches the destination. After five hops, the sum represents the total distance hopped, not the remaining distance to the destination.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the sum, verify the steps by ensuring that the operations with fractions are correct and that the formula for the sum of a geometric series is applied accurately.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
