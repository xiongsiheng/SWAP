{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Remember the midpoint formula for a segment \\(\\overline{AB}\\) with endpoints \\(A(x_1, y_1)\\) and \\(B(x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\).\n\n2. **Equations of Lines:** Use the slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\) to find the equations of lines \\(\\overline{AE}\\) and \\(\\overline{CD}\\). The slope \\(m\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\).\n\n3. **Intersection of Lines:** To find the intersection point \\(F\\) of two lines, solve the system of equations formed by the lines. Set the equations equal to each other and solve for \\(x\\), then substitute \\(x\\) back into either equation to find \\(y\\).\n\n4. **Coordinate Geometry Accuracy:** Double-check all calculations involving coordinates and slopes to avoid arithmetic errors. Ensure that coordinates are correctly substituted into formulas.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification:** If possible, sketch the lines and points on a coordinate plane to visually confirm the correctness of the intersection point and the coordinates of \\(F\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
