{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Relationships:** Identify and clearly understand the relationships given among the variables. In this case, \\(A+2 = B-2 = C \times 2 = D \\div 2\\) establishes a chain of equalities.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the relationships to express all variables in terms of a single variable. This simplifies the system of equations and makes it easier to solve.\n\n3. **Sum Constraint:** Utilize the given sum of the integers (36 in this case) to form another equation that can be solved simultaneously with the derived expressions.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with multiple operations and substitutions, to avoid simple mistakes.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After finding the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\), ensure that all original conditions and the sum constraint are satisfied. This step confirms the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
