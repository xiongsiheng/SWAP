{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly identify what the problem is asking. In this case, you need to find a negative integer \\( N \\) such that \\( N + N^2 = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Formulate the equation correctly based on the given information. Here, it translates to \\( N^2 + N = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use appropriate methods to solve quadratic equations, such as factoring or using the quadratic formula \\( N = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Checking for Real Solutions:** Ensure that the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) is non-negative to guarantee real solutions.\n\n5. **Validating the Solution:** After finding potential solutions, verify that they meet the conditions of the problem (e.g., being a negative integer). Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to confirm correctness.\n\n6. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and calculations, especially when dealing with negative numbers, as these can lead to common errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
