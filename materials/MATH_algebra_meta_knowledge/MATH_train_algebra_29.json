{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. The formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of a geometric sequence is \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Calculating the Common Ratio:** The common ratio \\(r\\) can be found by dividing any term by the preceding term. In this case, \\(r = \frac{-6}{6} = -1\\).\n\n3. **Using the Formula Correctly:** When applying the formula \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), ensure that you correctly substitute the values for \\(a_1\\), \\(r\\), and \\(n\\). For example, for the \\(205^{th}\\) term, \\(n = 205\\).\n\n4. **Handling Negative Exponents:** Be cautious when dealing with negative exponents, especially if the common ratio is negative. Remember that \\(r^{-k} = \frac{1}{r^k}\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After calculating the \\(205^{th}\\) term, double-check your calculations to ensure that there are no arithmetic errors, especially when raising numbers to large powers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
