{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Inequalities:** Understand how to solve quadratic inequalities by finding the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation (in this case, $-b^2 + 7b - 10 = 0$). Use these roots to determine the intervals where the inequality holds.\n\n2. **Factoring:** Practice factoring quadratic expressions accurately. For example, if the quadratic is $-b^2 + 7b - 10$, factor it into $(b - 2)(5 - b)$ to easily find the roots.\n\n3. **Sign Analysis:** Perform a sign analysis of the quadratic expression across the intervals defined by its roots. This helps in determining where the expression is non-negative.\n\n4. **Maximizing Values:** When looking for the greatest value of $b$ that satisfies the inequality, focus on the upper bound of the interval where the quadratic expression is non-negative.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting the value back into the original inequality to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
