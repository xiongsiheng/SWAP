{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the slope of a line given in standard form (Ax + By = C), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form to Slope-Intercept Form:** Convert the equation from standard form \\(Ax + By = C\\) to slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope. To do this, solve the equation for \\(y\\).\n\n2. **Slope Calculation:** Once in slope-intercept form, the coefficient of \\(x\\) directly represents the slope \\(m\\). Ensure you correctly isolate \\(y\\) and identify the coefficient of \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved in rearranging the equation. Errors in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can lead to an incorrect slope.\n\n4. **Signs and Coefficients:** Be mindful of the signs of coefficients, especially when moving terms from one side of the equation to the other. Incorrect handling of signs can result in an incorrect slope.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the slope by substituting values of \\(x\\) into the original and transformed equations to check if the same \\(y\\) values are obtained, confirming the correctness of the slope.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the slope of a line from its equation in standard form."}
