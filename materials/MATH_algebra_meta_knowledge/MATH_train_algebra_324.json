{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** Accurately evaluate the function at each specified point. For example, for \\( f(n) \\), correctly substitute \\( n \\) into the appropriate piece of the piecewise function based on the value of \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Equation Solving:** When solving the equation \\( f(-2) + f(2) + f(a) = 0 \\), first determine the values of \\( f(-2) \\) and \\( f(2) \\) using the function definition. Then, solve for \\( f(a) \\) by setting the sum equal to zero.\n\n3. **Piecewise Function Handling:** Be mindful of which part of the piecewise function to use for each value of \\( n \\). For instance, use \\( n^2 - 2 \\) if \\( n < 0 \\) and \\( 2n - 20 \\) if \\( n \\geq 0 \\).\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of \\( a \\), verify that each value satisfies the original equation by substituting back into \\( f(a) \\).\n\n5. **Positive Difference Calculation:** When calculating the positive difference between two values, ensure you subtract the smaller value from the larger value to get a positive result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
