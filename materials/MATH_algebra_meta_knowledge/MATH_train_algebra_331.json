{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the equation given is a Diophantine equation, which means it involves finding integer solutions. Focus on techniques specific to solving Diophantine equations.\n\n2. **Factoring Techniques:** Look for ways to factor or rewrite the equation to make it easier to solve. Sometimes, expressing the equation in a different form can reveal patterns or solutions more easily.\n\n3. **Substitution and Elimination:** Consider using substitution or elimination methods to simplify the equation. For instance, you might solve for one variable in terms of the other and then substitute back into the original equation.\n\n4. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers, systematically check possible integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy the equation. This can be done by setting up a range based on the constraints of the problem.\n\n5. **Minimizing the Difference:** When aiming to minimize \\(|a - b|\\), consider pairs of integers that are close to each other. This approach can help in quickly identifying the minimal difference.\n\n6. **Verification:** Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they are correct. This step is crucial in catching any errors in your calculations or assumptions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
