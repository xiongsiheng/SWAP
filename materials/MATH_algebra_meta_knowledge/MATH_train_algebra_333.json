{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex fractions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Complex Conjugates:** Use the complex conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the imaginary part. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly when multiplying the numerator by the conjugate of the denominator. Ensure that each term in the numerator is multiplied by each term in the conjugate.\n\n3. **Simplifying After Multiplication:** After multiplying, combine like terms in both the numerator and the denominator. Remember that \\(i^2 = -1\\), which will help in simplifying expressions involving \\(i\\).\n\n4. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts:** Once simplified, separate the result into its real and imaginary components. This helps in clearly identifying the real and imaginary parts of the fraction.\n\n5. **Double-Check Operations:** Always double-check your arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative signs and complex numbers, as these are common areas for errors.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate simplification of complex fractions."}
