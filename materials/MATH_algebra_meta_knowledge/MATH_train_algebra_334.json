{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For \\( f(g(a)) \\), first apply \\( g \\) to \\( a \\) and then apply \\( f \\) to the result.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting \\( g(a) \\) into \\( f \\), ensure you substitute correctly. For example, if \\( g(a) = b \\), then \\( f(g(a)) = f(b) \\).\n\n3. **Solving Equations:** When solving for \\( a \\) from the equation \\( f(g(a)) = 8 \\), isolate \\( a \\) carefully. This might involve solving a quadratic equation.\n\n4. **Checking Constraints:** Always check that the solution satisfies the given constraints (e.g., \\( a > 0 \\)). This ensures that the solution is valid within the problem's context.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and roots, as these can be prone to errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
