{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving ratios and fractions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** Recognize that ratios like \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) and \\(\\frac{p}{n}\\) represent relationships between different quantities. Understanding these relationships is crucial for combining them correctly.\n\n2. **Combining Ratios:** When combining ratios, ensure that the common terms cancel out properly. For example, if you need to find \\(\\frac{m}{q}\\), you might need to express \\(m\\) and \\(q\\) in terms of a common variable or through a series of steps involving other given ratios.\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** Use substitution to replace variables with their given values or expressions derived from other ratios. Simplify the resulting expression step by step to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Check Units and Dimensions:** Although not applicable here, in more complex problems, checking that units or dimensions align correctly can prevent errors, especially in physics or engineering contexts.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the value of \\(\\frac{m}{q}\\), consider verifying your solution by substituting back the values of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\) to ensure the original conditions are satisfied.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving ratios and fractions."}
