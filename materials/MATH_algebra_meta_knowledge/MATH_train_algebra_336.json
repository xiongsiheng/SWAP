{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** Remember the vertex formula for a quadratic equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\). This formula helps you find the x-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n2. **Vertex Coordinates:** Once you have the x-coordinate, substitute it back into the original equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n3. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula \\( d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\) to calculate the distance between two points. Ensure you correctly substitute the coordinates of the vertices into the formula.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when calculating the coordinates of the vertices and the distance between them, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your calculations by plotting the points or using a different method to confirm the distance. This step can help catch any errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
