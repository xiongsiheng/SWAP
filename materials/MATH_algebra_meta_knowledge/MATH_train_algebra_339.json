{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the radius \\( r \\) of a circle inscribed within three mutually externally tangent circles, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Formula:** Ensure you correctly interpret the given formula for \\( r \\). The formula involves reciprocals and a square root term, which requires careful handling.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting the values \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 9 \\), and \\( c = 36 \\) into the formula, make sure to substitute each value accurately to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** When dealing with fractions, simplify them step by step. For instance, calculate \\( \frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \frac{1}{b} \\), and \\( \frac{1}{c} \\) first, then sum these values.\n\n4. **Square Root Calculation:** When computing the square root term \\( \\sqrt{\frac{1}{ab} + \frac{1}{ac} + \frac{1}{bc}} \\), ensure that the sum inside the square root is calculated correctly before taking the square root.\n\n5. **Combining Terms:** Combine the terms \\( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \\) and the square root term, then add 2 times the square root term. This step requires careful addition and multiplication.\n\n6. **Reciprocal Calculation:** After obtaining the value of \\( \frac{1}{r} \\), remember to take the reciprocal to find \\( r \\). This step is crucial as it directly gives the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\n7. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your calculations by checking if the computed \\( r \\) satisfies the original formula with the given values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors and ensure accurate computation of \\( r \\)."}
