{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the given information. For example, if the numbers are \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), you can write \\( x - y = 3 \\) and \\( x + y = 31 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneously:** Solve the system of equations simultaneously to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Adding the two equations can help eliminate one variable quickly.\n\n3. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic when solving for the variables to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Identify the Larger Number:** Once you have the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), compare them to determine which is larger.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the values back into the original conditions (difference and sum) to verify that your solution satisfies both conditions.\n\nThese steps will help ensure you correctly identify the larger number while minimizing errors."}
