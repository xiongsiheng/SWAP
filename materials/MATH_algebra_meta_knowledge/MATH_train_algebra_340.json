{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( r \\) in this polynomial function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution:** Accurately substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into the function \\( f(x) \\). This involves replacing every \\( x \\) in the polynomial with 2.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform all arithmetic operations carefully, especially when dealing with powers of 2 (e.g., \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)). Small arithmetic errors can significantly affect the result.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( r \\):** After substituting and simplifying, you will have an equation involving \\( r \\). Solve this equation for \\( r \\) by isolating \\( r \\) on one side of the equation. Ensure that you correctly handle the signs and operations.\n\n4. **Verification:** Once you find the value of \\( r \\), verify your solution by substituting \\( r \\) back into the function and checking if \\( f(2) = 0 \\). This step confirms the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( r \\) in polynomial functions."}
