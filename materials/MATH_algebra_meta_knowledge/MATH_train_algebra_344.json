{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Substitute the given solutions into the quadratic equation to form a system of equations. This directly relates the known values of \\( x \\) to the coefficients of the equation.\n\n2. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall that the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) can be used to find the roots of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). However, in this case, direct substitution is more straightforward.\n\n3. **System of Equations:** When you have two solutions for \\( x \\), you can set up two equations by substituting each solution into the quadratic equation and solving for \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with fractions and negative numbers, as these can lead to calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the value of \\( k \\), substitute it back into the original equation and check if the given solutions satisfy the equation. This step confirms the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
