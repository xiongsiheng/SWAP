{"Knowledge": "To accurately determine the greatest integer less than a given fraction, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractions:** Recognize that a fraction like $-\\frac{15}{4}$ represents a value between two consecutive integers. Specifically, $-\\frac{15}{4}$ is between -3 and -4.\n\n2. **Integer Division:** Perform integer division to quickly find the nearest whole number less than the fraction. For $-\\frac{15}{4}$, dividing -15 by 4 gives -3.75, which is closer to -4.\n\n3. **Rounding Down:** When dealing with negative numbers, rounding down means moving to the next lower integer. For -3.75, the greatest integer less than this value is -4.\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check your result by ensuring that the chosen integer is indeed less than the given fraction and that there is no larger integer that fits the criteria.\n\nBy applying these principles, you can accurately determine the greatest integer less than any given fraction."}
