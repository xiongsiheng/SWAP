{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand what is being asked. Here, you need to find a two-digit number \\( N \\) such that \\( N = P(N) + S(N) \\), where \\( P(N) \\) is the product of the digits of \\( N \\) and \\( S(N) \\) is the sum of the digits of \\( N \\).\n\n2. **Formulating the Equation:** Express \\( N \\) in terms of its digits. For a two-digit number \\( N \\), let \\( N = 10a + b \\), where \\( a \\) is the tens digit and \\( b \\) is the units digit. Then, \\( P(N) = a \\cdot b \\) and \\( S(N) = a + b \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Condition:** Use the given condition \\( N = P(N) + S(N) \\) to set up an equation. Substitute \\( N = 10a + b \\) into the equation \\( 10a + b = a \\cdot b + a + b \\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Equation:** Simplify the equation to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Notice that the \\( b \\) terms on both sides cancel out, leading to \\( 10a = a \\cdot b + a \\).\n\n5. **Solving for Digits:** Solve the simplified equation to find possible values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). This might involve testing small integer values for \\( a \\) and solving for \\( b \\).\n\n6. **Checking Validity:** Ensure that the digits \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) form a valid two-digit number and satisfy the original condition.\n\n7. **Focus on the Units Digit:** Once you have identified the valid \\( N \\), focus on finding its units digit as required by the problem.\n\nThese steps should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
