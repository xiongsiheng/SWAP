{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when interpreting graphs and determining function values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Graph Reading Accuracy:** Ensure you accurately read the y-coordinate from the graph at the specified x-coordinate. Use the grid lines to help pinpoint exact points.\n\n2. **Integer Values:** When the problem specifies that the output is an integer, focus on the points on the graph where the y-coordinate clearly aligns with a grid line marking an integer value.\n\n3. **Graph Scaling:** Be aware of the scale of the graph axes. This helps in accurately estimating or reading off values, especially if the axes are not labeled with exact values.\n\n4. **Function Behavior:** Understand the general behavior of the function around the point of interest. This can help in confirming the value obtained from the graph reading.\n\n5. **Cross-Check:** If possible, cross-check the value obtained from the graph with any known properties of the function or any additional information provided in the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while determining function values from graphs."}
