{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Arithmetic Progression (AP) Properties:** Recall that in an arithmetic progression, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. If the first term is \\(a\\) and the common difference is \\(d\\), the terms are \\(a\\), \\(a + d\\), and \\(a + 2d\\).\n\n2. **Geometric Progression (GP) Properties:** In a geometric progression, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. If the first term is \\(a\\) and the common ratio is \\(r\\), the terms are \\(a\\), \\(ar\\), and \\(ar^2\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given transformations (adding 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term) to set up equations that relate the terms of the arithmetic progression to those of the geometric progression.\n\n4. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Be meticulous when solving simultaneous equations. Ensure that you correctly substitute and simplify expressions to find the values of the unknowns.\n\n5. **Checking for Validity:** After finding potential solutions, verify that they satisfy both the arithmetic and geometric progression conditions. This step ensures that the solutions are valid and correct.\n\n6. **Minimizing Values:** When asked for the smallest possible value, consider all possible solutions and select the minimum. This often involves analyzing the constraints and ensuring that the values are feasible.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
