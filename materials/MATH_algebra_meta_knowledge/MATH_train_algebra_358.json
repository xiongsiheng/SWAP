{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying polynomial expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distribute the Minus Sign:** When subtracting polynomials, distribute the minus sign to each term in the polynomial being subtracted. This means changing the sign of each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. For example, \\(3r\\) and \\(7r\\) are like terms.\n\n3. **Arrange Terms by Degree:** After combining like terms, arrange the terms in descending order by degree (highest power of the variable first).\n\n4. **Check for Simplification Errors:** Double-check the arithmetic operations, especially when combining coefficients of like terms, to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Final Review:** After simplifying, review the expression to ensure no terms were omitted or incorrectly combined. This step helps catch any oversights.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying polynomial expressions."}
