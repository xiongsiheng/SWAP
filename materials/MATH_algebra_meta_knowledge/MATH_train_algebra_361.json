{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Difference of Squares:** Recognize that the expression \\(\frac{109^2 - 100^2}{9}\\) involves the difference of squares, which can be factored as \\((109 - 100)(109 + 100)\\). This simplification can greatly reduce the complexity of the problem.\n\n2. **Simplification Techniques:** After factoring, simplify the expression step by step. Ensure that each step is logically consistent and that you are not skipping any necessary steps.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with large numbers or when multiplying and dividing. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Checking Work:** After obtaining a solution, it can be helpful to re-calculate or use a different method to verify the answer, ensuring that the solution is indeed correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
