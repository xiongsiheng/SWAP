{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** When dealing with rational expressions, solutions that make the denominator zero are not valid. Always check if your solutions make the original denominator zero.\n\n2. **Clear Fractions:** If possible, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to clear fractions. This can simplify the equation and make it easier to solve.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be precise with algebraic manipulations, such as expanding, factoring, and simplifying. Incorrect handling of these steps can lead to wrong solutions.\n\n4. **Substitute Back:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. This step helps verify the correctness of your solution.\n\n5. **Consider All Possible Solutions:** When solving polynomial equations, remember that there could be multiple solutions. Ensure you explore all possible roots, especially when dealing with higher-degree polynomials.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
