{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when adding complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:** When adding or subtracting complex numbers, handle the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, if you have \\( (a + bi) + (c + di) \\), the result is \\( (a + c) + (b + d)i \\).\n\n2. **Signs of Imaginary Parts:** Pay close attention to the signs of the imaginary parts, especially when they are negative, as these can easily lead to arithmetic mistakes.\n\n3. **Simplify the Result:** After combining the real and imaginary parts, simplify the expression if necessary. Ensure that the result is in the standard form \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Recheck your calculations for both the real and imaginary parts to ensure accuracy, as errors in either part can lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while performing operations with complex numbers."}
