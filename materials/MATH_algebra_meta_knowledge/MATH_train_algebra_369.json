{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the correct formula for compound interest, which is \\(A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(n\\) years, including interest; \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money); \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal); \\(n\\) is the number of times the interest is compounded per year; and \\(t\\) is the number of years the money is invested.\n\n2. **Correct Interest Rate:** Ensure that the interest rate is correctly converted from a percentage to a decimal. For example, 6% should be written as 0.06 in the formula.\n\n3. **Accurate Calculations:** Be meticulous with calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and decimal places. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Rounding:** When rounding to the nearest whole number, ensure you follow standard rounding rules (round up if the decimal is 0.5 or greater, round down if it is less than 0.5).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your final answer by ensuring it makes sense logically (e.g., the amount should be greater than the initial investment due to interest).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
