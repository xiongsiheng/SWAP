{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractions:** Ensure you understand how to add and divide fractions correctly. Remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\n2. **Simplifying Algebraically:** Simplify the equation step by step, combining like terms and simplifying fractions before proceeding to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving for \\( x \\), substitute the value back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step helps catch any mistakes made during simplification or solving.\n\n4. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the operations involved, especially the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), to avoid common errors in arithmetic and algebraic manipulation.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure that all terms in the equation are consistent in terms of units or denominators, which is crucial when dealing with fractions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
