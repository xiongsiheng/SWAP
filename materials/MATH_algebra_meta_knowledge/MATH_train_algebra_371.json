{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Combine Like Terms:** Start by combining all like terms in the expression. This simplifies the expression and makes it easier to factor.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly when factoring out common factors. Remember that \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\).\n\n3. **Check for Common Factors:** Identify and factor out any common factors from all terms. This includes both numerical coefficients and variable terms.\n\n4. **Perfect Squares and Cubes:** Be aware of special forms like perfect squares and cubes, which can simplify the factoring process.\n\n5. **Verify by Expansion:** After factoring, always expand your result to verify that it matches the original expression. This step ensures that your factorization is correct.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate factoring of algebraic expressions."}
