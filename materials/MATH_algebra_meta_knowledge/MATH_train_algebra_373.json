{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Define Variables Clearly:** Clearly define the three consecutive integers. For example, let the first integer be \\( n \\), the second integer be \\( n + 1 \\), and the third integer be \\( n + 2 \\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation:** Use the given information to set up an equation. In this case, the sum of the first and third integers is given, so you would write \\( n + (n + 2) = 118 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:** Solve the equation step by step, ensuring that each step is logically correct. Combine like terms and isolate \\( n \\) to find the value of the first integer.\n\n4. **Find the Second Integer:** Once you have the value of the first integer \\( n \\), add 1 to find the value of the second integer.\n\n5. **Check Your Work:** Verify that the integers you found are indeed consecutive and that their sum matches the given condition. This step helps ensure the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
