{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) represents the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). This means \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) is an integer.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Since \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\cdot x = 70\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) must be a factor of 70. List the factors of 70 to identify possible values for \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\).\n\n3. **Solving for x:** For each possible \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), solve for \\(x\\) by dividing 70 by \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\). Ensure that the resulting \\(x\\) is greater than \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) but less than \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1\\).\n\n4. **Checking Validity:** Verify that the calculated \\(x\\) satisfies the original equation \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\cdot x = 70\\) to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n5. **Precision in Calculations:** When expressing \\(x\\) as a decimal, use precise calculations to avoid rounding errors that could affect the validity of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
