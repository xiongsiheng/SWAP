{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perimeter and Area:** Recall the formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter \\( P \\) is given by \\( P = 2(l + w) \\), where \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width. The area \\( A \\) is given by \\( A = l \times w \\).\n\n2. **Integer Dimensions:** Since the length and width are integers, consider pairs of integers that satisfy the given perimeter condition.\n\n3. **Systematic Approach:** Use a systematic approach to find all possible pairs of integers that add up to half of the perimeter (since \\( l + w = 50 \\)). This ensures you do not miss any possible solutions.\n\n4. **Calculating Areas:** For each pair of dimensions, calculate the area and keep track of the smallest area found.\n\n5. **Checking All Combinations:** Ensure you check all combinations of \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) that sum to 50, including cases where \\( l \neq w \\), as the least area might not come from a square.\n\n6. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Be cautious of off-by-one errors and ensure that calculations are precise to avoid incorrect conclusions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
