{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For \\( t(f(x)) \\), first evaluate \\( f(x) \\) and then use the result as the input for \\( t(x) \\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values into functions, ensure that you substitute correctly. For example, if \\( f(x) = 5 - t(x) \\), substitute \\( x \\) into \\( t(x) \\) first, then subtract the result from 5.\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** Be meticulous when simplifying expressions, especially involving square roots. Ensure that you handle the arithmetic correctly under the square root.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) strictly to avoid errors in calculation.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each step, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested functions and complex expressions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
