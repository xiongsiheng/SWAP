{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the other root of a quadratic equation given one root, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\). This property can be used to find the other root once one root is known.\n\n2. **Product of Roots:** The product of the roots of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(\frac{c}{a}\\). This can be a double-check for your calculations.\n\n3. **Substitution:** Substitute the known root into the equation to find the value of the constant \\(k\\). This step is crucial to ensure the equation is correctly balanced.\n\n4. **Quadratic Formula:** If needed, use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots, but typically, using the sum or product of roots is more straightforward.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your calculations by substituting both roots back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the other root in such problems."}
