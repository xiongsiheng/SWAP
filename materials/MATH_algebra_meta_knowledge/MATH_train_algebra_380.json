{"Knowledge": "To determine the range of a linear function \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) over a given interval, consider the following:\n\n1. **Function Behavior:** Since \\( a < 0 \\), the function \\( f(x) \\) is decreasing. This means that as \\( x \\) increases, \\( f(x) \\) decreases.\n\n2. **Endpoints Evaluation:** Evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval \\( [0, 1] \\). At \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = b \\). At \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) = a + b \\).\n\n3. **Range Determination:** Since \\( f(x) \\) is decreasing, the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) occurs at \\( x = 0 \\) and the minimum value occurs at \\( x = 1 \\). Therefore, the range of \\( f(x) \\) is from \\( f(1) \\) to \\( f(0) \\).\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** Express the range in interval notation by listing the values from the minimum to the maximum. Since \\( a < 0 \\), \\( a + b < b \\), so the range is \\( [a + b, b] \\).\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the range of the function \\( f(x) \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)."}
