{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the given information into a system of linear equations. For example, if \\( b \\) represents the cost of a burger and \\( s \\) represents the cost of a soda, you can set up equations based on the purchases: \\( 3b + 2s = 3.20 \\) and \\( 2b + s = 2.00 \\).\n\n2. **Converting Units:** Ensure all monetary amounts are in the same unit. Since the question asks for the cost in cents, convert dollars to cents (e.g., $3.20 = 320 cents).\n\n3. **Solving the System:** Use algebraic methods such as substitution or elimination to solve the system of equations. Be meticulous with arithmetic to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of \\( b \\) and \\( s \\), substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions.\n\n5. **Focus on Precision:** Pay close attention to the precision of your calculations, especially when dealing with decimal points and fractions, as these can lead to inaccuracies.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
