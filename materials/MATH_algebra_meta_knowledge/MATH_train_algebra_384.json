{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly identify what is being asked. In this case, you need to find the width of a rectangle that minimizes the perimeter while ensuring the area is at least 100 square feet.\n\n2. **Formulating Equations:** Use the given relationships to set up equations. For a rectangle, the area (A) is given by \\( A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \\), and the perimeter (P) is given by \\( P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width}) \\). Here, the length is 15 feet more than the width.\n\n3. **Setting Up Inequalities:** Since the area must be at least 100 square feet, you will need to solve an inequality like \\( \text{width} \times (\text{width} + 15) \\geq 100 \\).\n\n4. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** When solving quadratic inequalities, ensure you correctly identify the critical points (roots of the equation) and determine the intervals where the inequality holds True.\n\n5. **Minimizing the Perimeter:** To minimize the perimeter, consider the symmetry and properties of quadratic functions. The width that satisfies the area requirement and minimizes the perimeter is typically found at the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic equation.\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding the width, calculate the corresponding length and verify that the area is indeed at least 100 square feet and that the perimeter is minimized. This step ensures your solution meets all the criteria of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
