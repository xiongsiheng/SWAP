{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the square of a complex number, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Complex Number Representation:** Recall that a complex number is represented as \\( z = a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) is the real part and \\( b \\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Multiplication of Complex Numbers:** Use the distributive property to multiply complex numbers. For example, if \\( z_1 = a + bi \\) and \\( z_2 = c + di \\), then \\( z_1 \\cdot z_2 = (a + bi)(c + di) \\).\n\n3. **Handling \\( i^2 \\):** Remember that \\( i^2 = -1 \\). This is crucial when squaring a complex number, as it affects the real and imaginary parts of the result.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After multiplication, combine like terms and simplify the expression. Ensure that the real part and the imaginary part are correctly identified and separated.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by comparing it with the known properties of complex numbers, such as the modulus and argument of \\( z^2 \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
