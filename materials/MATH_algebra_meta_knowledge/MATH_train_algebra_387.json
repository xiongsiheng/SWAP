{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Formulas:** Be familiar with the formulas for volume and surface area of a rectangular box. The volume \\( V \\) is given by \\( V = l \times w \times h \\), where \\( l \\), \\( w \\), and \\( h \\) are the length, width, and height, respectively. The surface area \\( A \\) is given by \\( A = 2(lw + lh + wh) \\). The sum of the lengths of the edges \\( E \\) is given by \\( E = 4(l + w + h) \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given information to set up a system of equations. This will help in finding the dimensions of the box.\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Solve the system of equations carefully to find the values of \\( l \\), \\( w \\), and \\( h \\). Ensure that the solutions satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n4. **Calculating New Volume:** After finding the original dimensions, calculate the new volume by increasing each dimension by one inch. The new volume \\( V' \\) is given by \\( V' = (l+1) \times (w+1) \times (h+1) \\).\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify all arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with multiplications and additions, to avoid simple mistakes.\n\n6. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the new dimensions and volume make sense in the context of the problem. For example, the new volume should be greater than the original volume.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
