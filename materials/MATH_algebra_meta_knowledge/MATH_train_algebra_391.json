{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** Recall that the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) essentially 'undoes' the function \\( f(x) \\). For \\( f(x) = \frac{16}{5 + 3x} \\), to find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), you need to solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) where \\( y = f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Solving for Inverse:** To find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), set \\( y = \frac{16}{5 + 3x} \\) and solve for \\( x \\). This involves isolating \\( x \\) and expressing it in terms of \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Handling Algebraic Manipulations:** Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with fractions and solving equations. Ensure that each step is logically sound and that you correctly cross-multiply or simplify fractions.\n\n4. **Substitution and Evaluation:** Once you have \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), substitute \\( x = 2 \\) to find \\( f^{-1}(2) \\). Then, calculate \\( \\left[f^{-1}(2)\right]^{-2} \\). Ensure that you correctly handle the exponentiation, especially since it involves a negative exponent.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each step, especially after complex algebraic manipulations or substitutions, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
