{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding expressions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Remember that the distributive property states \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\). Apply this rule correctly to distribute the constant across each term inside the parentheses.\n\n2. **Multiplication Accuracy:** Ensure that you multiply each term inside the parentheses by the constant outside the parentheses accurately. Double-check your multiplication to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n3. **Simplification:** After expanding, simplify the expression if possible. Combine like terms or simplify any fractions or radicals that result from the expansion.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure that you perform operations in the correct sequence, especially if the expression becomes more complex.\n\n5. **Consistency in Notation:** Use consistent notation and be clear in your steps to avoid confusion or mistakes in interpretation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding expressions."}
