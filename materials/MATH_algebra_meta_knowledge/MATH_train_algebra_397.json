{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation given. In this case, \\(a * b = a^2 + ab - b^2\\). Make sure you apply this formula correctly.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values into the formula, ensure that you substitute both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) correctly. Double-check that you are using the correct values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved. Ensure that you correctly square numbers, multiply them, and then add or subtract the results as specified by the formula.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to avoid errors in calculation. This is crucial when dealing with multiple operations in a single expression.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating, it's a good practice to verify your result by substituting the values back into the original problem definition to ensure it satisfies the given operation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
