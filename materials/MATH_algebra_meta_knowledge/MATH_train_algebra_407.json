{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation given. In this case, \\(a * b\\) is defined as \\(2a - b^2\\). Make sure you apply this definition correctly.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values into the operation, ensure that you substitute both variables correctly. For example, if \\(a * 5 = 9\\), substitute \\(a\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(5\\) for \\(b\\) in the expression \\(2a - b^2\\).\n\n3. **Solving Equations:** When solving for a variable, isolate the variable step by step. In this case, you need to isolate \\(a\\) from the equation \\(2a - 5^2 = 9\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when squaring numbers or performing multiplications and subtractions. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
