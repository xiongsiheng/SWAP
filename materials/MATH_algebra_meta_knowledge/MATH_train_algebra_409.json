{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding products of polynomials, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly, ensuring that each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Maintain the correct order of operations, which is to multiply before adding or subtracting.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After distributing, combine like terms to simplify the expression. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n4. **Attention to Signs:** Pay close attention to the signs of each term when distributing and combining, as errors often occur with negative signs.\n\n5. **Double-Check Work:** After completing the expansion, double-check your work by ensuring that no terms were omitted or incorrectly combined.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding polynomial products."}
