{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula correctly to find the distance between two points. The formula is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Coordinate Geometry:** Understand that since point \\(P\\) lies on the line \\(x = -3\\), its coordinates can be represented as \\((-3, y)\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(y\\):** Set up the equation using the distance formula with the given points and solve for \\(y\\). This will likely involve squaring both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\n4. **Quadratic Equations:** When you obtain a quadratic equation in \\(y\\), solve it using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. Remember that a quadratic equation can have two, one, or no real solutions.\n\n5. **Product of Roots:** If the quadratic equation is in the form \\(ay^2 + by + c = 0\\), the product of the roots (the possible \\(y\\)-coordinates) can be found directly using the relationship \\(c/a\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding the possible \\(y\\)-coordinates, verify that each satisfies the original distance condition to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
