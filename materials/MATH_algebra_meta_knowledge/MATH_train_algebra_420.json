{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex expressions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly. For example, \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\). Ensure you multiply each term inside the parentheses by the term outside.\n\n2. **Handling Imaginary Numbers:** Remember that \\(i^2 = -1\\). This is crucial when simplifying expressions involving \\(i\\).\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After distributing, combine like terms. Real parts should be combined with real parts, and imaginary parts with imaginary parts.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative signs and complex numbers, as these can lead to common errors.\n\n5. **Final Simplification:** Ensure that the final expression is in the standard form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying complex expressions."}
