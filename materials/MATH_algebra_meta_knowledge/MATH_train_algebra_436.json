{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Composition:** When evaluating \\( f(f(x)) \\), first find \\( f(x) \\) and then use that result to find \\( f(f(x)) \\). This step-by-step approach helps avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** When dealing with fractions, simplify each part separately before combining them. This can prevent errors in addition and multiplication of fractions.\n\n3. **Handling Negative Exponents:** Remember that \\( x^{-1} = \frac{1}{x} \\). This conversion is crucial for simplifying the function correctly.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After simplifying each part of the function, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested functions.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Substitute the final answer back into the function to verify that it satisfies the original expression. This step is essential to catch any errors that might have occurred during the simplification process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
