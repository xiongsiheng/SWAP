{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the operation defined by \\(a\\star b = a^b + ab\\). This means you need to compute both \\(a^b\\) and \\(ab\\) and then sum them.\n\n2. **Systematic Testing:** Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, systematically test pairs of values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to find which pair satisfies the equation \\(a\\star b = 15\\).\n\n3. **Checking All Combinations:** Ensure you check all possible combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) within the given constraints to avoid missing a solution.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved, especially when calculating powers and products, as these can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a pair \\((a, b)\\) that satisfies the equation, verify by substituting these values back into the original operation to ensure the result is indeed 15.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
