{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding and Simplifying:** When dealing with polynomial equations, ensure you expand and simplify correctly. For example, expand \\((x-3)(x+3)\\) to \\(x^2 - 9\\) and then combine like terms with the other side of the equation.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) when solving for the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the standard form of the quadratic equation.\n\n3. **Identifying Distinct Solutions:** Ensure that the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) is positive for the quadratic equation to have two distinct real solutions. This step is crucial to confirm the existence of two distinct solutions.\n\n4. **Calculating the Difference:** Once you have the distinct solutions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), calculate \\(p - q\\) carefully. This involves simple arithmetic but requires precision to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
