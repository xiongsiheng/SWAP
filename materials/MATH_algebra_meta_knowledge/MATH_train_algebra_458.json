{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Invertibility:** Recall that a function is invertible if and only if it is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective). This means that each input has a unique output and each output corresponds to a unique input.\n\n2. **Graphical Intersection:** When considering the intersection of graphs \\( y = f(x^2) \\) and \\( y = f(x^4) \\), remember that they intersect where their outputs are equal, i.e., \\( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \\). Since \\( f \\) is invertible, this implies \\( x^2 = x^4 \\), which simplifies to \\( x^2(x^2 - 1) = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Equations:** When solving equations like \\( x^2 = x^4 \\), factorize and find all possible solutions. In this case, \\( x^2 = 0 \\) or \\( x^2 = 1 \\), leading to \\( x = 0, 1, -1 \\).\n\n4. **Counting Intersections:** Ensure you count all distinct solutions to the equation \\( x^2 = x^4 \\) to determine the number of intersection points. Each distinct \\( x \\) value corresponds to a unique intersection point on the graphs.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your solutions by substituting them back into the original equations to confirm that they indeed satisfy \\( f(x^2) = f(x^4) \\). This step helps avoid miscounting or overlooking any intersection points.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
