{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the number of x-intercepts of a parabola given in the form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given equation \\( x = -2y^2 + y + 1 \\) represents a parabola that opens sideways (along the x-axis) because it is in the form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\).\n\n2. **Setting x to Zero:** To find the x-intercepts, set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\). This involves solving the quadratic equation \\( 0 = -2y^2 + y + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Use the quadratic formula \\( y = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( a = -2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\). Calculate the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\) to determine the number of real solutions.\n\n4. **Interpreting the Discriminant:** If \\( \\Delta > 0 \\), there are two distinct real solutions (two x-intercepts). If \\( \\Delta = 0 \\), there is one real solution (one x-intercept). If \\( \\Delta < 0 \\), there are no real solutions (no x-intercepts).\n\n5. **Precision in Calculations:** Ensure accurate calculations, especially when computing the discriminant and solving for \\( y \\), as errors here can lead to incorrect conclusions about the number of x-intercepts.\n\n6. **Graphical Understanding:** Optionally, visualize or sketch the parabola to confirm the number of intercepts, which can help verify the algebraic solution.\n\nThese guidelines will help minimize errors in determining the number of x-intercepts for a given parabola."}
