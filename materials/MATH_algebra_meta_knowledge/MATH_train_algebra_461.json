{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving quadratic equations like this one, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients from the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and apply the formula accurately.\n\n2. **Discriminant Check:** Before solving, calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to ensure the equation has real solutions. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic, especially when calculating the square root of the discriminant and performing division in the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Solution Verification:** After finding the solutions, substitute them back into the original equation to verify they are correct.\n\n5. **Choosing the Greater Solution:** Once you have both solutions, compare them directly to identify the greater one. This step is straightforward but ensures you select the correct answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations."}
