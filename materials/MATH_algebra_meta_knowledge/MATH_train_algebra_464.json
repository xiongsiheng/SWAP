{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** When you cross-multiply to eliminate fractions, ensure that you multiply the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction correctly.\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** Before cross-multiplying, simplify the fractions if possible. For example, \\(\\frac{3x - 1}{4x - 4}\\) can be simplified by factoring out the common factor in the denominator.\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** After cross-multiplying, solve the resulting linear equation by isolating the variable. Be careful with the distribution and combining like terms.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After finding the value of \\(x\\), substitute it back into the original equation to ensure it does not make any denominator zero, as this would create an extraneous solution.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and their simplification, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
