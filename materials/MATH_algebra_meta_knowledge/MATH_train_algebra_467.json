{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that function composition involves applying one function to the result of another. For example, \\( f(g(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( g \\) to \\( x \\), then apply \\( f \\) to the result of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you apply the functions in the correct order. Start by evaluating the innermost function first and work outward.\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, make sure you substitute correctly. Double-check that you are using the correct function and the correct value at each step.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding or multiplying, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your final answer by substituting the intermediate results back into the functions to ensure they match the expected values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
