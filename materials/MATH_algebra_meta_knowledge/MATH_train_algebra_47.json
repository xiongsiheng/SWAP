{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by the quadratic equation \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) is found using the formula \\(-\frac{b}{2a}\\). This formula is derived from completing the square or using calculus to find the maximum or minimum point.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** To determine the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), set up a system of equations using the given points. Each point \\((x, y)\\) provides an equation \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\). Solve this system to find \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Symmetry of Parabolas:** Parabolas are symmetric about the vertical line through the vertex. If two points have the same \\(y\\)-coordinate, like \\((-1, 7)\\) and \\((5, 7)\\), the vertex lies halfway between these \\(x\\)-coordinates, which simplifies to \\(\frac{-1 + 5}{2} = 2\\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** After calculating the vertex's \\(x\\)-coordinate, verify your calculations by ensuring the symmetry and the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are consistent with the given points.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, sketch a rough graph of the parabola using the given points to visually confirm the position of the vertex.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
