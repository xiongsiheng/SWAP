{"Knowledge": "To determine the range of a rational function like this, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Identify the Domain:** First, determine the domain of the function by finding where the denominator is zero. This helps in understanding where the function is undefined.\n\n2. **Simplify the Function:** If possible, simplify the function by canceling out common factors in the numerator and the denominator. This can reveal the behavior of the function more clearly.\n\n3. **Analyze Vertical Asymptotes:** Understand the behavior of the function near its vertical asymptotes, if any. This can affect the range.\n\n4. **Check for Horizontal or Slant Asymptotes:** Determine if the function has horizontal or slant asymptotes, as these can also influence the range.\n\n5. **Evaluate End Behavior:** Examine the end behavior of the function as \\( x \\) approaches infinity and negative infinity. This helps in understanding the limits of the function.\n\n6. **Test Specific Values:** Plug in specific values of \\( x \\) to see the corresponding \\( y \\) values. This can help identify any gaps or specific points in the range.\n\n7. **Combine Information:** Use all the gathered information about the function's behavior, asymptotes, and specific values to determine the complete range in interval notation.\n\nThese steps will help in accurately determining the range of the given rational function."}
