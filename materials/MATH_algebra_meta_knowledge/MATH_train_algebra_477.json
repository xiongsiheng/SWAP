{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Piecewise Functions:** Ensure you correctly interpret the conditions under which each piece of the piecewise function is applied. For example, in this problem, \\( f(x) \\) changes based on whether \\( x \\ge -4 \\) or \\( x < -4 \\).\n\n2. **Nested Function Evaluation:** When evaluating \\( f(f(x)) \\), first determine which piece of \\( f \\) applies to \\( x \\), then use that result to determine which piece of \\( f \\) applies to \\( f(x) \\). This step-by-step evaluation is crucial to avoid confusion.\n\n3. **Solving Equations:** When solving for \\( x \\) such that \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\), set up the equation based on the definition of \\( f \\) and solve it piece by piece. Ensure you consider all possible cases where \\( f(x) \\) could equal 5.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential values of \\( x \\), verify each solution by substituting it back into the original function to ensure \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\). This step helps catch any errors in the solving process.\n\n5. **Counting Solutions:** Be meticulous in counting the number of solutions. It's easy to overlook or double-count solutions if you're not careful.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
