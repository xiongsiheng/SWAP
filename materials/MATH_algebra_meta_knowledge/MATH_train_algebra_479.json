{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have exactly one solution, the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) must be equal to zero. This is because the discriminant determines the number of real solutions: zero for complex solutions, one for a single real solution (a repeated root), and two for two distinct real solutions.\n\n2. **Formulating the Discriminant:** In the given equation \\(4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0\\), identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) (which are 4, \\(n\\), and 25 respectively). Then, set up the discriminant condition: \\(n^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 25 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(n\\):** Solve the resulting equation from the discriminant condition to find \\(n\\). Ensure you correctly handle the arithmetic, especially when squaring \\(n\\) and multiplying constants.\n\n4. **Positive Value Requirement:** Since the problem asks for the positive value of \\(n\\), ensure that you only consider or report the positive solution if you get two possible values for \\(n\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, once you find \\(n\\), you can substitute it back into the original equation to confirm that the discriminant is indeed zero, thus verifying your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
