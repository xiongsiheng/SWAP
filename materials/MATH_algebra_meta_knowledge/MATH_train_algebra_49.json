{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Complex Number Representation:** Recall that a complex number is represented as \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Sum of Complex Numbers:** When adding complex numbers, add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together separately. For example, \\((a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i\\).\n\n3. **Using Given Conditions:** Utilize the given conditions such as \\(b = 1\\) and \\(e = -a - c\\) directly in the equations to simplify the problem.\n\n4. **Equality of Complex Numbers:** Two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real parts and their imaginary parts are equal.\n\n5. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute the known values into the equation representing the sum of the complex numbers and simplify step by step to find the unknowns.\n\n6. **Checking Consistency:** Ensure that the final values for \\(d\\) and \\(f\\) are consistent with the given conditions and the overall sum of the complex numbers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving complex numbers."}
