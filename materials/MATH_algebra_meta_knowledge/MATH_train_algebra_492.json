{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding products like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly. Multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure that multiplications are performed before any additions or subtractions.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms to simplify the expression. This step is crucial to ensure the expression is in its simplest form.\n\n4. **Careful with Signs:** Pay attention to the signs of each term, especially when multiplying terms that result in negative coefficients.\n\n5. **Double-Check Multiplication:** Verify each multiplication step to avoid common errors such as forgetting to multiply a term or miscalculating a product.\n\nThese guidelines will help you accurately expand and simplify the given product."}
