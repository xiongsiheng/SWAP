{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the distance between two points, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula correctly: \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Coordinate Subtraction:** Ensure that you subtract the coordinates correctly. The order of subtraction does not affect the result due to the squaring operation, but maintaining a consistent order can help avoid confusion.\n\n3. **Square Roots:** When taking the square root of a number, ensure that you are calculating it correctly. Remember that the square root function returns a non-negative value.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when squaring numbers and calculating square roots, as these steps are critical to the accuracy of the final result.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations to ensure that no arithmetic errors have been made during the process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
