{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula correctly: \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). Ensure you substitute the coordinates accurately into the formula.\n\n2. **Square Roots and Squares:** When squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, be cautious of extraneous solutions. Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When you obtain a quadratic equation, solve it using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. Check for real and valid solutions.\n\n4. **Product of Roots:** If you need the product of all possible values for a variable in a quadratic equation, remember that for \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the product of the roots is given by \\(\\frac{c}{a}\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic and algebraic manipulations, as errors in these steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
