{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Difference of Squares:** Recognize that the expression \\(525^2 - 475^2\\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored using the formula \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\). This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\n2. **Simplification Techniques:** Apply the difference of squares formula correctly to avoid algebraic mistakes. Ensure that you correctly identify \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as 525 and 475, respectively.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** When performing the addition and subtraction inside the factored form \\((a + b)(a - b)\\), double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by calculating \\(525^2\\) and \\(475^2\\) separately and then subtracting these values directly, although this method is more time-consuming and prone to calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
