{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** Recall that for a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the roots is given by \\(\frac{c}{a}\\). In this case, for \\(2x^2 - mx + n = 0\\), the sum of the roots is \\(-\frac{-m}{2} = \frac{m}{2}\\) and the product of the roots is \\(\frac{n}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given information about the sum and product of the roots to set up equations. Here, you have \\(\frac{m}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\frac{n}{2} = 10\\).\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** Solve these equations to find \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). From \\(\frac{m}{2} = 6\\), you get \\(m = 12\\), and from \\(\frac{n}{2} = 10\\), you get \\(n = 20\\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Desired Value:** Once you have \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), simply add them together to find \\(m + n\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are correct, especially when dealing with fractions and simplifying expressions.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving this type of problem."}
