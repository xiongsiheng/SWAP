{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding products of binomials, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **FOIL Method:** Use the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) to ensure you multiply all pairs of terms correctly. This method helps in systematically multiplying the first terms, the outer terms, the inner terms, and the last terms of the binomials.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** After multiplying, combine like terms to simplify the expression. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding or subtracting the products of the terms. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Check Your Work:** After completing the expansion, it can be helpful to check your work by substituting a simple value for \\(x\\) into both the original expression and your expanded form to verify they yield the same result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding binomial products."}
