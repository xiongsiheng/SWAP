{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expressing a quadratic equation in the form \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** This method involves transforming the quadratic expression \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) into a perfect square trinomial plus a constant. Ensure you correctly identify the coefficient \\(a\\) and factor it out if necessary.\n\n2. **Square Formation:** When completing the square, add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \\(x\\) inside the expression. This step is crucial to form the perfect square trinomial.\n\n3. **Constant Adjustment:** After forming the perfect square, adjust the constant term to balance the equation. This will give you the value of \\(k\\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by expanding the completed square form and ensuring it matches the original quadratic expression.\n\n5. **Focus on the Constant \\(k\\):** Since the question asks specifically for \\(k\\), ensure that your final step isolates this constant correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
