{"Knowledge": "To accurately determine the value of \\( p(1.5) \\) from the graph of the function \\( y = p(x) \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Graph Interpretation:** Understand that the graph provides a visual representation of the function. The y-coordinate of the point on the graph where \\( x = 1.5 \\) directly gives the value of \\( p(1.5) \\).\n\n2. **Precision in Reading Graphs:** When reading values from a graph, especially when dealing with non-linear functions, ensure you are as precise as possible. Use the grid lines and any available scales to help estimate values accurately.\n\n3. **Integer Values:** Since the problem states that \\( p(1.5) \\) is an integer, focus on the points on the graph where the y-coordinate is clearly an integer. This simplifies the task as you only need to consider those specific points.\n\n4. **Cross-Check:** If possible, cross-check your reading by looking at neighboring points or using the general shape of the graph to confirm that your reading is consistent with the overall behavior of the function.\n\nBy applying these guidelines, you can minimize errors in reading and interpreting the graph to find the correct value of \\( p(1.5) \\)."}
