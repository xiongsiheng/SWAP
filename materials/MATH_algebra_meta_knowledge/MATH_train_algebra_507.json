{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Common Denominator:** Identify and use a common denominator to combine fractions. In this case, the common denominator is \\((x+3)\\), which should be applied to all terms.\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** After combining fractions, simplify the numerator. Ensure that you correctly distribute and combine like terms.\n\n3. **Isolating Variables:** Once the equation is simplified, isolate the variable \\(x\\) by performing appropriate algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** Since the equation involves denominators, there is a possibility of introducing extraneous solutions (values that make the denominator zero). Always check that your solution does not make any denominator zero.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
