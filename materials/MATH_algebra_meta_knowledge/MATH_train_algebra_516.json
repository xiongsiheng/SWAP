{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating percentage increases, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentage Increase:** A percentage increase of \\( x\\% \\) on a number \\( N \\) means adding \\( x\\% \\) of \\( N \\) to \\( N \\). This can be calculated as \\( N + \\left( \frac{x}{100} \times N \right) \\).\n\n2. **Correct Calculation:** Ensure that you correctly calculate the percentage value. For example, \\( 120\\% \\) of \\( 50 \\) is \\( \frac{120}{100} \times 50 \\).\n\n3. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as adding the percentage directly to the number without converting the percentage to its decimal form first.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your arithmetic to ensure that the calculations are accurate, as errors in multiplication or addition can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating percentage increases."}
