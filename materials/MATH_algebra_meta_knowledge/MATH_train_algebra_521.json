{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Common Denominator:** When dealing with fractions that sum to another fraction, find a common denominator to combine the fractions into a single fraction. In this case, you can express the equation as $\\frac{x + y}{xy} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\n\n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** After combining the fractions, you can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions, resulting in an equation that is easier to manipulate algebraically.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Substitution:** Notice that the equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$. This suggests that if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then $(y, x)$ is also a solution. Use this symmetry to simplify the search for solutions.\n\n4. **Factoring and Simplification:** When you have an equation involving products and sums of variables, try to factor or rearrange the equation to make it easier to solve. For instance, you might end up with an equation like $xy = 18(x + y)$, which can be rearranged to $(x - 18)(y - 18) = 324$.\n\n5. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, you need to find pairs of integers that satisfy the equation. Start with the smallest possible values for $x$ and $y$ and check if they satisfy the original equation.\n\n6. **Minimizing the Sum:** To find the smallest possible value for $x + y$, systematically check pairs of integers that satisfy the equation, focusing on pairs that yield the smallest sum.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
