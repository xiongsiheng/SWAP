{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value inequality \\(\\lvert a \rvert \\le b\\) translates to \\(-b \\le a \\le b\\). This means you need to solve for \\(a\\) within the bounds set by \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Solving Linear Inequalities:** When solving linear inequalities, if you multiply or divide by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality sign.\n\n3. **Finding the Least Integer:** Once you have the range for \\(x\\), identify the least integer within that range. This involves understanding the concept of integer boundaries and ensuring you select the smallest possible integer that satisfies the inequality.\n\n4. **Double-Check Boundaries:** Ensure that the boundaries you calculate are correct by substituting them back into the original inequality to confirm they satisfy the condition.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your final answer by checking if the least integer value of \\(x\\) indeed satisfies the original inequality.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
