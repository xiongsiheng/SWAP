{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving floor and ceiling functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor -2.54 \\rfloor = -3\\).\n\n2. **Understanding Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function, denoted by \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\), returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lceil 25.4 \\rceil = 26\\).\n\n3. **Applying Functions Correctly:** Ensure that you apply the floor and ceiling functions correctly to the given numbers. Misapplying these functions can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Performing Arithmetic:** After applying the floor and ceiling functions, perform the required arithmetic operations carefully. Simple arithmetic errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations to ensure that you have applied the functions and performed the arithmetic correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating expressions involving floor and ceiling functions."}
