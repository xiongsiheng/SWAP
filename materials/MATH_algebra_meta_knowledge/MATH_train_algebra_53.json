{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when dealing with arithmetic operations and order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Understand the correct order of operations, where subtraction is left-associative. This means that in the expression \\(a - b - c\\), you should subtract \\(b\\) from \\(a\\) first, and then subtract \\(c\\) from the result.\n\n2. **Parentheses Usage:** Be aware that parentheses can change the order of operations. For example, \\(a - (b - c)\\) is different from \\(a - b - c\\) because the parentheses group \\(b - c\\) together, making it a single term.\n\n3. **Correcting Mistakes:** If you realize you've made a mistake in the order of operations, carefully re-evaluate the expression using the correct order to find the True value.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** Once you find the correct value, substitute it back into the original problem to verify that it matches the given correct answer. This step ensures that your correction is accurate.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can avoid common pitfalls and accurately solve problems involving arithmetic operations and order of operations."}
