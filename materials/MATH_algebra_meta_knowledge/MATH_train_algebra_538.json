{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Roots in Ratios:** If the roots of a quadratic equation are in a given ratio, you can express the roots as \\(2r\\) and \\(r\\) where \\(r\\) is a common factor.\n\n2. **Using the Sum and Product of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the roots is \\(\frac{c}{a}\\). Apply these properties to set up equations.\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the fact that the sum of the roots \\(2r + r = 3r\\) and the product of the roots \\(2r \\cdot r = 2r^2\\) to form equations based on the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n\n4. **Solving for \\(r\\):** From the sum of the roots, you can express \\(r\\) in terms of the coefficients of the quadratic equation. Substitute this value into the product of the roots equation to find \\(k\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find \\(k\\), substitute it back into the original equation to ensure the roots satisfy the given ratio. This step helps verify the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
