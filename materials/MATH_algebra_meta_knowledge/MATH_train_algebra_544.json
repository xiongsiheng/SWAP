{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Use the substitution method effectively by substituting the known value of \\( y \\) from one equation into the other equation. In this case, substitute \\( y = 7 \\) into \\( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When you have a quadratic equation in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the solutions for \\( x \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Sum of Solutions:** For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the solutions \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) is given by \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\). This can be a quick way to check your solutions without needing to find each solution individually.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy both equations.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, as these can lead to calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such systems of equations."}
