{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Circle Equation:** Recognize that the given equation \\(x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0\\) needs to be transformed into the standard form of a circle equation \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** Use the method of completing the square for both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms to rewrite the equation in standard form. This involves adding and subtracting appropriate constants to form perfect square trinomials.\n\n3. **Radius Relationship:** Understand that the radius \\(r\\) in the standard form equation is related directly to the constant term on the right-hand side. If the radius is given as 4, then \\(r^2 = 16\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(c\\):** After transforming the equation into standard form, compare the constant term on the right-hand side with \\(r^2\\) to solve for \\(c\\). Ensure that the arithmetic operations are correct during this comparison.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the value of \\(c\\) back into the original equation and check if the resulting circle indeed has a radius of 4. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
