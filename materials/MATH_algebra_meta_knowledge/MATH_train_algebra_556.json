{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formula for Diagonals in a Polygon:** The number of diagonals \\( d \\) in a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula \\( d = \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \\). This formula accounts for each diagonal being counted twice (once from each endpoint).\n\n2. **Solving for \\( n \\):** When you have the number of diagonals and need to find the number of sides, rearrange the formula to solve for \\( n \\). This involves setting up a quadratic equation and solving for \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Ensure that the solution for \\( n \\) is a positive integer, as the number of sides in a polygon must be a whole number.\n\n4. **Verification:** Once you find a value for \\( n \\), verify it by substituting it back into the formula to ensure it correctly predicts the given number of diagonals.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
