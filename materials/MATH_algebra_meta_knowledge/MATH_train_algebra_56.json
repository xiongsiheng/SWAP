{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Exponent Rules:** Remember the rule that states when multiplying numbers with the same base, you add the exponents. For example, \\(10^a \\cdot 10^b = 10^{a+b}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Exponents:** When adding exponents, ensure you add them correctly. For example, \\(0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.9 = 2\\).\n\n3. **Final Calculation:** After combining the exponents, simplify the expression to its final form. For example, \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding decimal numbers, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by calculating each term separately and then multiplying them together to see if you get the same result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
