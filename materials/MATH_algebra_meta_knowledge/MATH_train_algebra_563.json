{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Quadratic:** The vertex form of a quadratic equation is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex of the parabola. Use this form to understand the symmetry of the parabola.\n\n2. **Symmetry of Parabolas:** Parabolas are symmetric about the vertical line through the vertex. This means that the \\(x\\)-intercepts are equidistant from the vertex's \\(x\\)-coordinate.\n\n3. **Calculating the Other \\(x\\)-Intercept:** Since the parabola is symmetric, the distance from the vertex's \\(x\\)-coordinate to each \\(x\\)-intercept is the same. If one \\(x\\)-intercept is \\(-2\\), the other \\(x\\)-intercept can be found by reflecting \\(-2\\) across the vertex's \\(x\\)-coordinate of 3.\n\n4. **Reflection Across the Vertex:** To find the other \\(x\\)-intercept, subtract the distance from the vertex to the given \\(x\\)-intercept from the vertex's \\(x\\)-coordinate. The distance from 3 to \\(-2\\) is \\(3 - (-2) = 5\\), so the other \\(x\\)-intercept is \\(3 + 5 = 8\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure the symmetry and distances are correctly applied, as this will confirm the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
