{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) for the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). This will help you understand the conditions for the roots.\n\n2. **Discriminant:** For the quadratic equation to have real and distinct solutions, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be greater than zero. In this case, \\(k^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8 > 0\\).\n\n3. **Integer Solutions:** If the solutions are to be integers, the discriminant must be a perfect square. This means \\(k^2 - 64\\) must be a perfect square.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots:** If the roots are integers, use the fact that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\). Here, the sum of the roots is \\(\\frac{k}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Checking Values:** Test possible integer values for \\(k\\) that make the discriminant a perfect square and ensure the roots are distinct integers.\n\n6. **Sum Calculation:** Once you identify valid values of \\(k\\), sum them up correctly to get the final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
