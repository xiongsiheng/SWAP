{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Multiplication of Complex Numbers:** Use the distributive property to multiply complex numbers, similar to multiplying binomials. Remember to distribute each term in the first complex number to each term in the second complex number.\n\n2. **Handling Imaginary Units:** Be cautious with the imaginary unit \\(i\\). Recall that \\(i^2 = -1\\), and simplify any terms that include \\(i^2\\) accordingly.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After multiplication, combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. Ensure that you correctly identify and combine all like terms.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the resulting expression to the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers. This involves ensuring that all \\(i\\) terms are combined and that the real and imaginary parts are correctly separated.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to signs and arithmetic operations, as errors often occur in these areas when dealing with complex numbers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving the multiplication and simplification of complex numbers."}
