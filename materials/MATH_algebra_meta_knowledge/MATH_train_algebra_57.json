{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio:** Determine the constant factor by which each term is multiplied to get the next term. This is typically found by dividing any term by its preceding term.\n\n2. **Apply the Ratio Consistently:** Once the common ratio is identified, apply it consistently across the sequence to find unknown terms. Ensure that you multiply correctly to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n3. **Sequence Term Calculation:** Calculate each missing term by multiplying the preceding term by the common ratio. Double-check each multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Sum of Terms:** When finding the sum of two terms (like \\(x + y\\)), ensure that you correctly identify which terms they are in the sequence and calculate their values accurately before summing.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), verify that each term in the sequence is correctly derived by the common ratio. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
