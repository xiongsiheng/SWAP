{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rewriting a quadratic expression in the form \\(a(x+b)^2+c\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** This method involves transforming the quadratic expression into a perfect square trinomial plus a constant. Start by factoring out the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) from the first two terms.\n\n2. **Forming the Perfect Square:** Identify the coefficient of \\(x\\) within the parentheses, divide it by 2, and square it to find the constant that completes the square. Add and subtract this constant inside the parentheses.\n\n3. **Simplifying:** After completing the square, simplify the expression by combining constants and possibly distributing the leading coefficient back through the perfect square trinomial.\n\n4. **Identifying Constants:** Once the expression is in the form \\(a(x+b)^2+c\\), identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) directly from the expression.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure accurate arithmetic throughout the process, as errors in calculations can significantly affect the final values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, expand the final form \\(a(x+b)^2+c\\) back to the quadratic form to verify that it matches the original quadratic expression.\n\nThese steps will help minimize mistakes and ensure the correct transformation of the quadratic expression."}
