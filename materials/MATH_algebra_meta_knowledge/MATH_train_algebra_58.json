{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing the sum of a geometric series, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio:** Determine the common ratio (r) of the series by dividing any term by the previous term. In this case, the common ratio is -2.\n\n2. **Use the Sum Formula:** The sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula \\( S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Terms:** Count the number of terms in the series to correctly apply the formula. For this series, there are 10 terms.\n\n4. **Handle Negative Signs Carefully:** Be cautious with negative signs, especially when dealing with the common ratio and when calculating powers of \\( r \\).\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation:** Double-check your calculations for the number of terms, the powers of \\( r \\), and the overall sum to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while computing the sum of a geometric series."}
