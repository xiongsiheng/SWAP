{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the common ratio of an infinite geometric series, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Terms:** Clearly identify the first few terms of the series. In this case, the terms are \\(\frac{5}{6}\\), \\(-\frac{4}{9}\\), and \\(\frac{32}{135}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Ratio:** The common ratio \\(r\\) is found by dividing each term by the previous term. For example, \\(r = \frac{-\frac{4}{9}}{\frac{5}{6}}\\) and \\(r = \frac{\frac{32}{135}}{-\frac{4}{9}}\\). Ensure you perform these divisions accurately.\n\n3. **Simplify Fractions:** When dividing fractions, remember to multiply by the reciprocal. For example, \\(\frac{a}{b} \\div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{d}{c}\\). Simplify the resulting fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Verify that the ratio between each pair of consecutive terms is consistent. This step confirms that the series is indeed geometric and that you have calculated the common ratio correctly.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to signs and arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative terms. Errors in signs or arithmetic can lead to incorrect common ratios.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the common ratio of an infinite geometric series."}
