{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Discounts:** A percentage discount reduces the original price by a certain fraction of itself. For example, a 20% discount on $30 means you pay 80% of $30, which is $30 * 0.80.\n\n2. **Successive Discounts:** When applying successive discounts, each discount is applied to the result of the previous discount. For instance, if the first discount is 20% and the second is 25%, calculate the first discount and then apply the second discount to the new price.\n\n3. **Combining Discounts:** To find a single equivalent discount, calculate the final price after all discounts and then determine what single discount would result in the same final price. This involves converting the final price back to a percentage of the original price and finding the difference.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with percentages, as small errors can significantly affect the final price.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by applying the discounts step-by-step and comparing the final price with the price obtained using the single equivalent discount.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
