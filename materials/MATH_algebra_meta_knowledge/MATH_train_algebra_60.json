{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Ensure you fully understand the definition of the operation. In this case, $\\#(a, b, c)$ is defined as $b^2 - 4ac$.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Accurately substitute the given values into the operation. For $\\#(1, 2, 3)$, substitute $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 3$ into the formula.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved. Calculate $b^2$ and $4ac$ separately before subtracting.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that each step is performed correctly. This includes squaring $b$, multiplying $4$ by $a$ and $c$, and then performing the subtraction.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Although not always necessary for simple operations like this, it's good practice to verify that your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
