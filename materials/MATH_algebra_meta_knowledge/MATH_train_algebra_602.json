{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Use algebraic identities such as the sum of squares and the product of sums. For example, recall that \\((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute the given values into the algebraic identities and simplify step by step. Ensure that each step is logically consistent and that you are not skipping any steps.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for any arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with squares and products of numbers.\n\n4. **Understanding Constraints:** Be aware of the constraints given in the problem, such as the numbers being nonnegative real numbers. This can help in interpreting the results correctly.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After finding the sum of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\), verify that the values satisfy both the original conditions (sum of squares and the product of sums). This step ensures that your solution is correct and meets all the criteria given in the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
