{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For example, \\( f(g(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( g \\) to \\( x \\), then apply \\( f \\) to the result.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating functions and their compositions.\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, make sure you substitute correctly and accurately to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After substituting, simplify the expressions step by step, ensuring each step is correct before moving on to the next.\n\n5. **Fraction Form:** When expressing the final answer as a fraction, ensure the fraction is in its simplest form, with no common factors between the numerator and the denominator.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your intermediate steps by substituting back and checking if the calculations hold True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
