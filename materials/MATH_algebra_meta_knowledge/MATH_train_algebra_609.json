{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function:** Clearly understand the function definition. Here, \\( E(a, b, c) = a \times b^c \\) means you are multiplying \\( a \\) by \\( b \\) raised to the power of \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting values into the function, ensure that you substitute correctly and simplify the resulting expression accurately. For instance, in \\( E(r, r, 3) \\), substitute \\( r \\) for both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and \\( 3 \\) for \\( c \\), leading to \\( r \times r^3 = r^4 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Exponential Equations:** When solving equations involving exponents, remember the properties of exponents, such as \\( a^m = a^n \\) implies \\( m = n \\) if \\( a \\) is positive and not equal to 1. Apply these properties correctly to isolate the variable.\n\n4. **Checking for Positive Solutions:** Since the problem specifies a positive value for \\( r \\), ensure that your solution is positive and satisfies the original equation.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting it back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points will help you minimize errors and ensure accuracy in solving the problem."}
