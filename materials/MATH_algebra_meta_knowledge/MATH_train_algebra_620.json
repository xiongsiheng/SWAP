{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing the sum of a geometric series, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the First Term and Common Ratio:** Determine the first term (a) and the common ratio (r) of the series. In this case, the first term is -1 and the common ratio is 3.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Formula:** The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula \\(S_n = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\\), where \\(S_n\\) is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Terms:** Ensure you correctly count the number of terms in the series. Here, there are 7 terms.\n\n4. **Calculate Powers Accurately:** When calculating \\(r^n\\), be careful with the exponentiation to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Simplify the Expression:** After substituting the values into the formula, simplify the expression step by step to get the final sum.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Recheck your calculations, especially the arithmetic operations and the use of the formula, to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while computing the sum of a geometric series."}
