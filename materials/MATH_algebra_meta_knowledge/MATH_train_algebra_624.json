{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by \\(b^2 - 4ac\\). In this case, since \\(b = 8\\), the condition becomes \\(64 - 4ac = 0\\).\n\n2. **System of Equations:** You will need to solve a system of equations. Here, you have \\(a + c = 10\\) and \\(64 - 4ac = 0\\). Solving these simultaneously will help find \\(a\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Inequality Constraint:** The condition \\(a < c\\) must be satisfied by the solutions. This will help in selecting the correct pair from possible solutions.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After solving the system, verify that the solutions satisfy both the original conditions and the inequality \\(a < c\\).\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Be cautious with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
