{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly identify the goal, which is to find the point where the mouse starts moving away from the cheese. This occurs when the mouse is perpendicular to the cheese.\n\n2. **Perpendicular Lines:** Recall that two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. For a line with slope \\( m \\), the slope of a perpendicular line is \\( -\frac{1}{m} \\).\n\n3. **Equation of a Line:** Use the point-slope form of a line equation, \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), where \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is a point on the line and \\( m \\) is the slope.\n\n4. **Intersection of Lines:** To find the point of intersection between two lines, solve the system of equations formed by the equations of the two lines.\n\n5. **Distance Calculation:** Ensure you correctly calculate the distance between two points using the distance formula, \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\), and verify that the point of intersection is indeed the closest point.\n\n6. **Substitution and Simplification:** Carefully substitute values into equations and simplify expressions to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n7. **Verification:** Double-check your final coordinates by ensuring they satisfy both the line equations and the condition of being the closest point to the cheese.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
