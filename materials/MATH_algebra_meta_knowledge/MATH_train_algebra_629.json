{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you have two equations: one from the problem statement ($a + b = 24$) and one from the given equation ($2ab + 10a = 3b + 222$). Solve these equations simultaneously.\n\n2. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve for one variable in terms of the other. For instance, you might solve for $b$ in terms of $a$ using the first equation and then substitute into the second equation.\n\n3. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, ensure that any solutions you find are indeed positive integers. This constraint can help you avoid non-integer or negative solutions.\n\n4. **Simplifying Algebraic Expressions:** Be meticulous when simplifying algebraic expressions, especially when dealing with terms involving both $a$ and $b$. Missteps in simplification can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a solution for $a$ and $b$, verify by substituting back into both original equations to ensure consistency. This step helps catch errors in algebraic manipulation or calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
