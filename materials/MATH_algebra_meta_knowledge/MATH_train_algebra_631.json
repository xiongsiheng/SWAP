{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Analysis:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) determines the nature of the roots. If \\(\\Delta < 0\\), the roots are non-real (complex).\n\n2. **Understanding Non-Real Roots:** If a quadratic equation has non-real roots, the discriminant must be negative. This is crucial for setting up the correct inequality.\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** When expressing the range of possible values for \\(b\\), use interval notation correctly. Remember that parentheses ( ) are used for open intervals (excluding endpoints), and brackets [ ] are used for closed intervals (including endpoints).\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Ensure that you correctly identify the boundaries of the interval. For example, if the inequality involves \\(b^2\\), consider both positive and negative values of \\(b\\) that satisfy the inequality.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your interval by testing values within and outside the interval to confirm that they either do or do not yield non-real roots.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
