{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Functions:** Recognize that exponential functions like \\(8^{4x-6}\\) and \\(\\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+5}\\) are based on powers of 2. Specifically, \\(8 = 2^3\\) and \\(\frac{1}{2} = 2^{-1}\\), which can simplify the equation.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When dealing with equations involving exponential expressions with the same base, you can set the exponents equal to each other. For example, if \\(2^a = 2^b\\), then \\(a = b\\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** After equating the exponents, you will typically have a linear equation to solve. Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations to avoid errors in simplification or solving for \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify your solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial as it helps catch any errors made during the solving process.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and operations, especially when dealing with negative exponents or when simplifying complex expressions. Small mistakes in these areas can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
