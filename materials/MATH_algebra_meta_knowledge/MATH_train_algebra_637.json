{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Compound Interest:** Compound interest is calculated based on the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is \\(A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(n\\) years, including interest, \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate, \\(n\\) is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and \\(t\\) is the number of years.\n\n2. **Different Compounding Periods:** When interest compounds quarterly, the number of compounding periods per year \\(n\\) is 4. When it compounds annually, \\(n\\) is 1. Ensure you use the correct value for \\(n\\) in the formula.\n\n3. **Partial Payments:** When calculating payments for partial periods, such as paying off half the balance after 5 years, calculate the balance at that point using the compound interest formula and then determine the interest for the remaining period on the reduced balance.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Use a calculator to ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and decimal places. Small errors in calculations can significantly affect the final result.\n\n5. **Rounding:** When rounding to the nearest dollar, ensure you round correctly according to standard rounding rules (round up if the decimal is 0.5 or more, round down if less than 0.5).\n\n6. **Comparison of Plans:** To find the difference between the total payments under the two plans, calculate the total amount paid under each plan separately and then subtract the smaller amount from the larger amount.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
