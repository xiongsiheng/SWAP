{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Transformations:** Recognize how transformations like scaling and stretching affect the graph of a function. Specifically, multiplying the function by a constant (like 2) stretches the y-coordinates by that factor, and multiplying the input by a constant (like 2x) compresses the x-coordinates by the reciprocal of that factor.\n\n2. **Area Scaling:** Understand that when you scale a function, the area of any geometric shape formed by points on the graph (like a triangle) scales by the product of the scaling factors in both the x and y directions. For example, if a function is scaled by a factor of 2 in the y direction and compressed by a factor of 2 in the x direction, the area of any shape formed by the transformed function points will be scaled by \\(2 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1\\), meaning the area remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualize or sketch the original and transformed graphs to better understand how the points and the resulting triangle change.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you correctly apply the scaling factors to both the x and y coordinates and calculate the new area accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** If possible, verify your calculations by checking specific points or using alternative methods to confirm the area of the new triangle.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
