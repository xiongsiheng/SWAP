{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the number of intersection points among three lines, consider the following:\n\n1. **System of Linear Equations:** Recognize that each pair of lines can be represented by a system of linear equations. Solving these systems will give the coordinates of the intersection points.\n\n2. **Line Compatibility:** Check if any lines are parallel (same slope) or identical (same slope and y-intercept). Parallel lines do not intersect, and identical lines intersect at infinitely many points.\n\n3. **Intersection Calculation:** Use algebraic methods (substitution or elimination) to find the intersection points of each pair of lines. Ensure that the solutions are consistent with the original equations.\n\n4. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, sketch the lines on a coordinate plane to visually confirm the number and location of intersection points.\n\n5. **Avoid Overcounting:** Be cautious not to count the same intersection point more than once, especially if it is the intersection of all three lines.\n\nBy applying these guidelines, you can accurately determine the number of intersection points among the given lines."}
