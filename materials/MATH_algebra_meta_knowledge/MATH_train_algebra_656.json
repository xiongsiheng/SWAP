{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving complex numbers, particularly powers of the imaginary unit \\(i\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cycle of Powers of \\(i\\):** Remember that the powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four terms: \\(i^1 = i\\), \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), \\(i^4 = 1\\), and then the cycle repeats. This pattern can be used to simplify any power of \\(i\\) by reducing the exponent modulo 4.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation:** Use the modulo operation to simplify large exponents. For example, \\(i^{11}\\) can be simplified by noting that \\(11 \\mod 4 = 3\\), so \\(i^{11} = i^3 = -i\\). Similarly, for \\(i^{111}\\), \\(111 \\mod 4 = 3\\), so \\(i^{111} = i^3 = -i\\).\n\n3. **Addition of Complex Numbers:** When adding complex numbers, add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together. In this case, since both \\(i^{11}\\) and \\(i^{111}\\) simplify to \\(-i\\), the sum is \\(-i + (-i) = -2i\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with modulo operations and complex number arithmetic, to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating expressions involving powers of the imaginary unit \\(i\\)."}
