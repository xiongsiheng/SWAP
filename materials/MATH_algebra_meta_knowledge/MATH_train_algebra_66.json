{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Square Properties:** Remember that the area of a square is given by the formula \\( \text{Area} = s^2 \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length. The perimeter of a square is given by \\( \text{Perimeter} = 4s \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given information to set up equations. For example, if the sum of the areas of two squares is 65, you can write \\( s_1^2 + s_2^2 = 65 \\). Similarly, if the difference in their areas is 33, you can write \\( s_1^2 - s_2^2 = 33 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Combine the equations to solve for the side lengths. You can add and subtract the equations to find \\( s_1^2 \\) and \\( s_2^2 \\). Then, take the square roots to find \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating Perimeters:** Once you have the side lengths, calculate the perimeters using the formula \\( 4s \\). Add the perimeters to find the total.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and calculations, especially when dealing with squares and square roots, as these operations can be prone to errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by substituting the side lengths back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy the given constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
