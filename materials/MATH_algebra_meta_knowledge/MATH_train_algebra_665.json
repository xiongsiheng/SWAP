{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the fifth term of a geometric sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio:** The common ratio \\( r \\) in a geometric sequence can be found by dividing the second term by the first term. In this case, \\( r = \frac{1/4}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n2. **Use the General Formula:** The \\( n \\)-th term of a geometric sequence can be found using the formula \\( a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)} \\), where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Correct Exponentiation:** Ensure that you correctly calculate the exponent when finding the \\( n \\)-th term. For the fifth term, you need to compute \\( r^4 \\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to your calculations, especially when multiplying fractions and dealing with exponents, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by calculating the intermediate terms (third and fourth) to ensure the sequence is consistent up to the fifth term.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
