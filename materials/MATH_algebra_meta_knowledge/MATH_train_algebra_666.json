{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization of Differences of Squares:** Recall that the equation \\(x^2 - y^2 = 51\\) can be factored as \\((x + y)(x - y) = 51\\). This factorization is key to finding integer solutions.\n\n2. **Integer Factor Pairs:** Identify all pairs of integers that multiply to 51. Since 51 is a product of primes (3 and 17), the factor pairs are \\((51, 1)\\) and \\((17, 3)\\).\n\n3. **System of Equations:** For each factor pair \\((a, b)\\), set up the system of equations \\(x + y = a\\) and \\(x - y = b\\). Solve these systems to find values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n4. **Checking for Positivity:** Ensure that both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers. This step is crucial as it filters out invalid solutions.\n\n5. **Counting Valid Pairs:** Count only the pairs \\((x, y)\\) that meet the criteria of being positive integers. This will give you the total number of valid solutions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically find and verify the correct number of pairs of positive integers that satisfy the given equation."}
