{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the correct formula for compound interest, which is \\(A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(n\\) years, including interest, \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal), \\(n\\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and \\(t\\) is the number of years the money is invested.\n\n2. **Frequency of Compounding:** Understand the impact of the frequency of compounding. More frequent compounding (like quarterly) results in higher returns compared to less frequent compounding (like yearly).\n\n3. **Calculations Accuracy:** Ensure accurate calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and decimal places. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Comparison of Final Amounts:** To find the difference in earnings, calculate the final amounts for both investments and then subtract the smaller amount from the larger amount.\n\n5. **Rounding:** When rounding to the nearest dollar, ensure you follow standard rounding rules (round up if the cent value is 0.5 or more, round down if it is less than 0.5).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
