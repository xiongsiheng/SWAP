{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating functions and performing operations like subtraction, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** When evaluating a function at a specific value, substitute the value directly into the function and perform the arithmetic carefully. Ensure that each term in the function is evaluated correctly.\n\n2. **Symmetry Consideration:** For functions that are symmetric (like even or odd functions), consider the properties of symmetry to simplify calculations. For example, if \\( f(x) \\) is an even function, \\( f(x) = f(-x) \\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with exponents and coefficients. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** After performing the calculations, double-check each step to ensure accuracy. This includes verifying the substitution and the arithmetic operations.\n\n5. **Using Calculators Wisely:** If using a calculator, ensure that you input the function and values correctly to avoid calculator-related errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating functions and performing arithmetic operations."}
