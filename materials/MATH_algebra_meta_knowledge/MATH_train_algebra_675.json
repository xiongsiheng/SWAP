{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving cube roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rationalization:** Rationalizing the denominator involves eliminating any radicals from the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by an appropriate expression.\n\n2. **Choosing the Correct Conjugate:** For cube roots, multiply by a form of 1 that includes the cube root of the radicand raised to the power that will eliminate the radical in the denominator. For example, to rationalize \\(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\), multiply by \\(\\sqrt[3]{5^2}\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** After multiplying, simplify both the numerator and the denominator, ensuring that all terms are combined correctly and that the denominator is free of radicals.\n\n4. **Checking Integer Conditions:** Ensure that the final expression is in the form \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt[3]{B}}{C}\\) where \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are integers, \\(C\\) is positive, and \\(B\\) is not divisible by the cube of any prime. This helps in verifying the conditions of the problem.\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:** Once the expression is correctly rationalized and simplified, calculate \\(A + B + C\\) to find the final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
