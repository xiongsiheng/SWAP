{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the domain of a function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify Denominator Zeros:** The domain of a rational function is all real numbers except where the denominator is zero. Find the values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero.\n\n2. **Solve Quadratic Equations:** If the denominator is a quadratic expression, solve \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). Ensure you correctly identify the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Check for Real Solutions:** If the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) is negative, the quadratic equation has no real solutions, and the denominator is never zero.\n\n4. **Express the Domain Correctly:** Once you find the values that make the denominator zero, exclude these from the set of all real numbers. Express the domain in interval notation or set-builder notation.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations for solving the quadratic equation and forming the domain to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while determining the domain of such functions."}
