{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving ceiling and floor functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ceiling and Floor Functions:** The ceiling function \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\) returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\), while the floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) returns the largest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Applying Functions Correctly:** Ensure you apply the ceiling and floor functions correctly to the given values. For example, \\(\\lceil \\frac{5}{4} \\rceil = 2\\) and \\(\\lfloor -\\frac{5}{4} \\rfloor = -2\\).\n\n3. **Handling Negative Numbers:** Be cautious when dealing with negative numbers. The floor of a negative number is less than the number itself, and the ceiling of a negative number is greater than the number itself.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After applying the ceiling and floor functions, simplify the resulting expression by performing the necessary arithmetic operations.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with mixed operations involving integers and fractions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
