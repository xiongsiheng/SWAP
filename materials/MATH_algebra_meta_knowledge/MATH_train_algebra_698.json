{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** Accurately evaluate the functions \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) at the given value (in this case, \\( x = 10 \\)). Ensure you substitute \\( x \\) correctly into each function.\n\n2. **Simplification of Expressions:** When simplifying the difference \\( f(10) - g(10) \\), be meticulous with each term. Combine like terms correctly and avoid common mistakes in addition and subtraction.\n\n3. **Solving for a Variable:** After setting up the equation \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\), solve for the variable \\( k \\) carefully. This involves isolating \\( k \\) and performing algebraic operations accurately.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with larger numbers or complex expressions. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Once you find the value of \\( k \\), substitute it back into the functions to verify that \\( f(10) - g(10) \\) indeed equals 10. This step ensures the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
