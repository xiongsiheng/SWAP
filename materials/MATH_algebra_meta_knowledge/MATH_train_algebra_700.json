{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly translate the problem into a system of linear equations. For example, if \\( e \\) represents the price of an enchilada and \\( t \\) represents the price of a taco, the given information translates to: \\( 2e + 3t = 2.50 \\) and \\( 3e + 2t = 2.70 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Systems of Equations:** Use appropriate methods (such as substitution or elimination) to solve the system of equations accurately. Be meticulous with arithmetic to avoid calculation errors.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After solving for \\( e \\) and \\( t \\), verify that these values satisfy both original equations to ensure correctness.\n\n4. **Calculating Final Answer:** Once you have the prices of enchiladas and tacos, carefully calculate the total cost of three enchiladas and four tacos, ensuring you use the correct values and perform the arithmetic correctly.\n\n5. **Rounding Correctly:** When expressing your final answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth, ensure you round appropriately according to standard rounding rules.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
