{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the correct formula for compound interest, which is \\( A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt} \\), where \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\( n \\) years, including interest; \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money); \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal); \\( n \\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year; and \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\n2. **Interest Rate Conversion:** Ensure the interest rate is in decimal form. For example, 10% should be converted to 0.10.\n\n3. **Correct Time Period:** Verify the number of years the money is invested for, as this directly affects the calculation of interest.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when calculating the compound interest to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Final Calculation Check:** Double-check the final calculation to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with exponents and decimal places.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
