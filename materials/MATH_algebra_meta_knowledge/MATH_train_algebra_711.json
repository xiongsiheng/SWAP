{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** When solving a system of linear equations, use methods like substitution or elimination to find the values of the variables. Ensure that you correctly isolate variables and substitute accurately.\n\n2. **Checking Solutions:** After solving for the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both equations.\n\n3. **Polynomial Evaluation:** When evaluating a polynomial expression like \\(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\\), ensure you substitute the correct values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and perform the arithmetic accurately. Pay special attention to signs and coefficients.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing operations, especially with polynomials, double-check your calculations to avoid common errors such as misplacing signs or misreading coefficients.\n\n5. **Simplification Steps:** Ensure that each step of simplification is correct, especially when combining like terms or performing multiplications. Small errors in these steps can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
