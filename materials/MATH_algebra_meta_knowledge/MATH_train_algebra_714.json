{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Multiplying by the Conjugate:** To simplify a complex fraction, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is \\(a - bi\\).\n\n2. **Distributing Correctly:** Ensure that you distribute correctly when multiplying complex numbers. Remember that \\((a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Real and Imaginary Parts:** After multiplication, separate the result into its real and imaginary parts. Combine like terms to simplify.\n\n4. **Checking the Result:** Verify that your final answer is in the standard form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers.\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Be cautious of common errors such as forgetting to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate or incorrectly combining real and imaginary parts.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying complex numbers."}
