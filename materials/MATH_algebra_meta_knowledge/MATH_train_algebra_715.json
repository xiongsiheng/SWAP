{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Compound Inequalities:** Recognize that this is a compound inequality where both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously: \\(1 < (x-2)^2 < 25\\). This means \\((x-2)^2\\) must be greater than 1 and less than 25.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** To solve \\(1 < (x-2)^2 < 25\\), first solve the inequalities separately: \\((x-2)^2 > 1\\) and \\((x-2)^2 < 25\\). This involves finding the roots of the equations \\((x-2)^2 = 1\\) and \\((x-2)^2 = 25\\), which are \\(x = 1, 3\\) and \\(x = -3, 7\\) respectively.\n\n3. **Determining the Solution Set:** Use the roots to determine the intervals that satisfy the inequality. For \\((x-2)^2 > 1\\), the solution is \\(x < 1\\) or \\(x > 3\\). For \\((x-2)^2 < 25\\), the solution is \\(-3 < x < 7\\). The intersection of these intervals gives the final solution set.\n\n4. **Summing Integer Solutions:** Identify all integer values within the solution set and sum them. Ensure you include all integers within the range and exclude those outside it.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify by substituting the integer solutions back into the original inequality to confirm they satisfy both parts of the compound inequality.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
