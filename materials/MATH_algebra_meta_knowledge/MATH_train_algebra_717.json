{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Techniques:** Recognize that the equation \\(x^2 - 2x = 0\\) can be factored into \\(x(x - 2) = 0\\). This simplifies finding the roots.\n\n2. **Zero Product Property:** Understand that if a product of two factors equals zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. Thus, \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x - 2 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Given Condition:** Since \\(x \neq 0\\) is given, you must disregard \\(x = 0\\) as a solution and only consider \\(x = 2\\).\n\n4. **Substitution Check:** Although not always necessary for simple problems, it's good practice to substitute your solution back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the given conditions and the steps of solving, as overlooking the condition \\(x \neq 0\\) could lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
