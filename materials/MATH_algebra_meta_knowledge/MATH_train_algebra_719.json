{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Time Calculation:** Convert all time units to a consistent format (e.g., hours or minutes) before performing calculations. For example, five minutes should be converted to hours if other times are in hours.\n\n2. **Distance-Speed-Time Relationship:** Use the formula \\( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \\) correctly for both biking and running segments. Ensure that the units for distance and speed are compatible.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Combine the times for biking and running with the fixed time (like changing shoes) to set up an equation that equals the total workout time.\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\):** When solving the equation for \\( x \\), ensure that you handle fractions and decimals accurately. Use parentheses appropriately in calculations to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Rounding:** When rounding to the nearest hundredth, follow standard rounding rules (e.g., 4.567 would round to 4.57).\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding \\( x \\), you can verify the solution by calculating the total time using the found speed and checking if it matches the given total workout time.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
