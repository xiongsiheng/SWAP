{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** Understand that the ratio of the areas of two squares is the square of the ratio of their side lengths. If the ratio of the areas is given as \\(\frac{192}{80}\\), then the ratio of the side lengths is the square root of this ratio.\n\n2. **Rationalizing Denominators:** When rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving square roots, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate any square roots in the denominator.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** Simplify fractions by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and dividing both by this GCD.\n\n4. **Identifying Integer Parts:** Identify the integer parts \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in the simplified form \\(\frac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}\\) by carefully isolating the square root and the integer components.\n\n5. **Summing Integers:** After identifying \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), add them together to find the sum \\(a + b + c\\). Ensure that the sum is calculated correctly by performing the addition accurately.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
