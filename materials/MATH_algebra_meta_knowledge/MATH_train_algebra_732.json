{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( g(f(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( f \\) to \\( x \\) and then apply \\( g \\) to the result of \\( f(x) \\). Ensure you correctly substitute the expression of \\( f(x) \\) into \\( g \\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) \\):** To find \\( g(25) \\), you need to determine the values of \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 25 \\). Solve the equation \\( 3x^2 - 2 = 25 \\) correctly, ensuring you isolate \\( x^2 \\) and then take the square root, considering both positive and negative roots.\n\n3. **Substitution into \\( g \\):** Once you have the values of \\( x \\), substitute each into \\( g(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \\) to find the corresponding values of \\( g \\). Ensure you substitute correctly and perform the arithmetic accurately.\n\n4. **Summing Results:** After finding all possible values of \\( g \\), sum them together. Double-check your addition to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solutions by checking if the values of \\( g \\) you found indeed satisfy the original conditions of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
