{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that function composition involves applying one function to the result of another. In this case, you first apply \\( g \\) to the input and then apply \\( f \\) to the result of \\( g \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating functions. First, evaluate the inner function \\( g(x) \\), and then use that result as the input for the outer function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, make sure you substitute correctly. For example, if \\( g(x) = x^2 \\), then \\( g(2) = 2^2 = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying or adding numbers. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the value of \\( f(g(2)) \\), you can quickly verify your result by ensuring that the steps are logically consistent and that the arithmetic is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
