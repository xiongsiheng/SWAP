{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand the process described. In this case, the ball bounces to \\(\frac{2}{3}\\) of the previous height each time.\n\n2. **Using Geometric Sequences:** Recognize that the heights form a geometric sequence where each term is \\(\frac{2}{3}\\) of the previous term. The general form of a geometric sequence is \\(a_n = a \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a\\) is the initial value, \\(r\\) is the common ratio, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Inequality:** To find when the height is less than 30 cm, set up an inequality \\(243 \\cdot (\frac{2}{3})^n < 30\\) and solve for \\(n\\).\n\n4. **Solving Exponential Inequalities:** When solving inequalities involving exponents, take logarithms of both sides to simplify. Be mindful of the properties of logarithms, especially how they affect the direction of the inequality when the base is less than 1.\n\n5. **Checking Your Answer:** After finding the approximate value of \\(n\\), verify by calculating the actual height after \\(n\\) bounces to ensure it is indeed less than 30 cm.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
