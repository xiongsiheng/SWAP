{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the domain of a function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For the function to be defined, the expression inside the floor function must not be zero, as division by zero is undefined.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** To find when \\(x^2 - 7x + 13\\) is not an integer, solve the inequality \\(x^2 - 7x + 13 \\neq n\\) for integer values of \\(n\\). This involves solving quadratic equations and determining intervals where the quadratic expression does not equal any integer.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Discriminant:** For the quadratic \\(x^2 - 7x + 13\\), calculate the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) to understand the nature of its roots. If \\(\\Delta < 0\\), the quadratic has no real roots, which affects the intervals where the function is defined.\n\n4. **Interval Analysis:** Determine the intervals where the quadratic expression is positive or negative, and identify where it equals any integer values to exclude these from the domain.\n\n5. **Combining Intervals:** Combine all valid intervals to form the domain, ensuring no gaps or overlaps. This step is crucial to accurately represent the domain of the function.\n\nBy applying these points, you can systematically determine the domain of the function with minimal errors."}
