{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Use the midpoint formula to find the center of the circle. The midpoint of a segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n2. **Distance Formula:** Apply the distance formula to find the length of the diameter. The distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n3. **Radius Calculation:** The radius of the circle is half the length of the diameter.\n\n4. **Area of a Circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, as these can lead to errors if not handled carefully.\n\n6. **Unit Consistency:** Make sure that all units are consistent and that the final answer is expressed in the correct form (in this case, in terms of \\(\\pi\\)).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
