{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) strictly. This means perform operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n2. **Rounding and Ceiling/Floor Functions:** Understand how the ceiling (\\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\)) and floor (\\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\)) functions work. The ceiling function rounds a number up to the nearest integer, and the floor function rounds it down to the nearest integer.\n\n3. **Fraction Operations:** When dealing with fractions, ensure you simplify them correctly before applying any operations. For example, when squaring a fraction, both the numerator and the denominator should be squared.\n\n4. **Decimal Precision:** Be precise with decimal calculations, especially when converting fractions to decimals for easier manipulation with ceiling and floor functions.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating, verify the steps by re-evaluating the expression to ensure no mistakes were made in the calculations or in applying the ceiling/floor functions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
