{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the intersection points of two parabolas and finding the difference between their x-coordinates, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Equations Equal:** To find the intersection points, set the equations of the parabolas equal to each other: \\(2x^2 - 4x + 4 = -x^2 - 2x + 4\\). This step is crucial as it directly leads to finding the x-coordinates of the intersection points.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When solving the resulting quadratic equation, use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) or factorize if possible. Ensure that you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n3. **Identifying Roots:** Once you have the roots of the quadratic equation, these are the x-coordinates of the intersection points. Ensure you correctly order them if there is a condition like \\(c \\ge a\\).\n\n4. **Calculating Difference:** Subtract the smaller x-coordinate from the larger one to find \\(c - a\\). This step is straightforward but requires careful attention to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the intersection points by substituting the x-coordinates back into either original equation to find the corresponding y-coordinates and ensure they match for both parabolas.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
