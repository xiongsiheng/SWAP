{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand the requirements. In this case, Alex needs to distribute coins such that each of his 12 friends gets a unique number of coins, starting from 1 up to 12.\n\n2. **Sum of First n Natural Numbers:** The total number of coins required to give each friend a unique number of coins from 1 to 12 is the sum of the first 12 natural numbers. This can be calculated using the formula \\(S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of friends.\n\n3. **Calculating the Required Coins:** Calculate the total number of coins needed using the formula mentioned above and then subtract the number of coins Alex already has to find out how many more coins are needed.\n\n4. **Attention to Detail:** Ensure that you accurately calculate the sum and perform the subtraction correctly to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the number of additional coins calculated is correct and sufficient for the problem's requirements.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
