{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Identify the variables and set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. For example, let \\( w \\) be the production rate of widgets per worker per hour, and \\( h \\) be the production rate of whoosits per worker per hour.\n\n2. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure that all units are consistent. For instance, if production rates are given in widgets or whoosits per hour, make sure all calculations adhere to this unit of time.\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Use algebraic methods to solve the system of equations. Techniques such as substitution or elimination can be effective.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to avoid simple computational errors.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** Once you have the values for \\( w \\) and \\( h \\), substitute them back into the equations to verify their correctness and use them to find the value of \\( m \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
