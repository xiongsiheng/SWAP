{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula correctly, which is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). In this case, the distance from the point \\((3\\sqrt{5}, d+3)\\) to the origin \\((0, 0)\\) is \\(\\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{5})^2 + (d+3)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions:** Ensure that you simplify expressions correctly, especially when squaring terms and combining like terms.\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** When solving for a variable like \\(d\\), isolate \\(d\\) on one side of the equation and solve carefully, ensuring that each step is logically sound.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, verify that the solution satisfies the original condition, as sometimes extraneous solutions can arise from incorrect algebraic manipulations.\n\n5. **Minimizing Values:** To find the smallest possible value of \\(d\\), consider the nature of the equation and whether it represents a quadratic or linear relationship, and use appropriate methods to find the minimum value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
