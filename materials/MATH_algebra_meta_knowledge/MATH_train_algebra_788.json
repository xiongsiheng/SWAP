{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of a function involving fractions with variables in the denominator, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Denominator Zeros:** The domain of a function is restricted where any denominator is zero, as division by zero is undefined. Set each denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\) to find these points.\n\n2. **Solve for \\( x \\):** For each denominator \\( x + 8 \\), \\( x^2 + 8 \\), and \\( x^3 + 8 \\), solve the equations \\( x + 8 = 0 \\), \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\), and \\( x^3 + 8 = 0 \\). Note that \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\) and \\( x^3 + 8 = 0 \\) do not have real solutions, as \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x^3 \\) would need to be negative real numbers to equal -8, which is impossible for real \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Exclude Points:** Exclude the values of \\( x \\) that make any denominator zero from the domain. In this case, only \\( x + 8 = 0 \\) gives \\( x = -8 \\).\n\n4. **Express Domain:** The domain is all real numbers except \\( x = -8 \\). This can be expressed as a union of intervals, typically written as \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, \\infty) \\).\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the domain of the function, avoiding common pitfalls related to undefined operations."}
