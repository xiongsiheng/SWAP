{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when performing operations with complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly when multiplying by a real number or another complex number. For example, \\(a(b + ci) = ab + aci\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** When you have real parts and imaginary parts, combine them separately. The real parts combine with each other, and the imaginary parts (those with \\(i\\)) combine with each other.\n\n3. **Subtraction of Complex Numbers:** Subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, \\((a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i\\).\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the expression by performing the arithmetic operations on the real and imaginary parts.\n\n5. **Final Form:** Ensure the final answer is in the standard form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while working with complex numbers."}
