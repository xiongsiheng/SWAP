{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rates and Times:** Ensure you correctly interpret the relationship between speed (rate), time, and distance. The formula to remember is \\(Distance = Rate \\times Time\\).\n\n2. **Average Speed vs. Instantaneous Speed:** The average speed given in the problem is for the entire trip, not individual segments. This average includes both the journey to the friend's house and the return trip.\n\n3. **Converting Units:** If times are given in minutes, convert them to hours to match the unit of the speed (miles per hour). For example, 10 minutes is \\(\\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6}\\) hours.\n\n4. **Total Distance Calculation:** To find the total distance, multiply the average speed by the total time. The total time is the sum of the time taken to go to the friend's house and the time taken to return home.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After calculating the total distance, double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy, as errors in unit conversion or multiplication can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
