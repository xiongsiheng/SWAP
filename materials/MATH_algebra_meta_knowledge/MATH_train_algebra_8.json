{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the distance between two points, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula correctly: \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Coordinate Subtraction:** Ensure that you subtract the coordinates correctly. For example, \\(x_2 - x_1\\) should be \\(7 - (-5)\\) which simplifies to \\(7 + 5\\).\n\n3. **Squaring Differences:** Square the differences of the coordinates accurately. For example, \\((7 - (-5))^2\\) is \\(12^2\\), not \\(2^2\\).\n\n4. **Adding Squares:** Add the squared differences correctly. For example, \\(12^2 + 5^2\\) is \\(144 + 25\\).\n\n5. **Square Root Calculation:** Take the square root of the sum accurately. For example, \\(\\sqrt{169}\\) is \\(13\\).\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and squaring operations, as these are common sources of error.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating the distance between two points."}
