{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Proportional Relationships:** Recognize that the time it takes to travel a certain distance is directly proportional to the distance traveled, assuming the speed remains constant. This means if June takes 4 minutes to travel 1 mile, she will take a longer time for a greater distance at the same speed.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Proportion:** Use the given information to set up a proportion. For example, if June takes 4 minutes to travel 1 mile, you can set up the proportion as \\(\frac{4 \text{ minutes}}{1 \text{ mile}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{3.5 \text{ miles}}\\).\n\n3. **Solving for the Unknown:** Solve the proportion by cross-multiplying and isolating the variable. Ensure that you perform the arithmetic correctly, especially when dealing with decimal numbers.\n\n4. **Double-Checking Calculations:** After solving for the unknown, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy. This includes verifying the multiplication and division steps.\n\n5. **Unit Consistency:** Ensure that all units are consistent throughout the problem. In this case, both distances are in miles and both times are in minutes, which simplifies the calculation process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
