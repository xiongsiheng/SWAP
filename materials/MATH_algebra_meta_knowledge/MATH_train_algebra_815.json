{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Relatively Prime Numbers:** Relatively prime numbers have no common factors other than 1. This means their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\n2. **Systematic Checking:** Since the integers are less than 20, systematically check pairs of numbers to see if their product plus their sum equals 103. Start with smaller numbers and move upwards to avoid missing any pairs.\n\n3. **Verification of Conditions:** Ensure that each pair you check meets both conditions: the product plus the sum equals 103, and the numbers are relatively prime.\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as miscalculating the product or sum, or incorrectly determining if two numbers are relatively prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Use of Time:** Use logical reasoning to narrow down the possibilities. For example, if the sum of two numbers is too large or too small, their product plus sum is unlikely to equal 103.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
