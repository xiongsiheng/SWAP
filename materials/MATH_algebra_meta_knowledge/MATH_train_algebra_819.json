{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Properties:** Remember that the equation \\(|A| = B\\) implies two separate cases: \\(A = B\\) and \\(A = -B\\). Apply this property to both sides of the equation.\n\n2. **Solving Linear Equations:** When solving for \\(x\\) in linear equations, ensure that you isolate \\(x\\) correctly. This involves proper distribution and cancellation of terms.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, substitute them back into the original equation to verify their correctness. This step is crucial for catching any errors in the solution process.\n\n4. **Comparing Values:** When asked to find the smallest value of \\(x\\), compare all valid solutions obtained from the equation to determine which one is the smallest.\n\n5. **Negative and Positive Considerations:** Be mindful of the implications of the absolute value, which can lead to both positive and negative solutions for \\(x\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
