{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have only one solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by \\(b^2 - 4ac\\).\n\n2. **Setting the Discriminant to Zero:** Set the discriminant equal to zero and solve for the variable \\(p\\). This will ensure that the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution.\n\n3. **Avoiding Zero Coefficients:** Ensure that the coefficient \\(a\\) (in this case, \\(p\\)) is not zero, as the problem specifies a nonzero \\(p\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic calculations, especially when squaring numbers and multiplying coefficients, as these steps are critical in determining the correct value of \\(p\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a value for \\(p\\), substitute it back into the original equation and check that the discriminant is indeed zero, confirming that the equation has only one solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
