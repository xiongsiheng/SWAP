{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to evaluate composite functions. Start by evaluating the inner function \\( g(x) \\) at the given value (in this case, \\( x = 3 \\)), and then use the result to evaluate the outer function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions:** When dealing with square roots and fractions, ensure that you simplify expressions correctly. For example, when simplifying \\( \frac{12}{\\sqrt{x}} \\), remember that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\) must be non-zero and positive.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions to avoid mistakes.\n\n5. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, ensure that you substitute correctly and accurately to avoid introducing errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
