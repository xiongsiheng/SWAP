{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the equation $|x - a| = b$ represents two points on the number line, specifically $x = a + b$ and $x = a - b$.\n\n2. **Calculating Roots:** Be precise when calculating roots, especially for non-integer exponents like the fifth root. For example, $\\sqrt[5]{16}$ should be calculated accurately to proceed with the solution.\n\n3. **Distance Between Points:** The length of the segment between two points $a$ and $b$ on the number line is given by $|a - b|$. Ensure you apply this correctly to find the segment length.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations for the roots and the distances to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Graphical Representation:** Optionally, visualizing the problem on a number line can help confirm the positions of the points and the segment length.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
