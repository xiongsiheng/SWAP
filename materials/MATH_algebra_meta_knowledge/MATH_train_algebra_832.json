{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operator:** Clearly understand the definition of the operator \\(\\bowtie\\). In this case, \\(a \\bowtie b\\) is defined as \\(a + \\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + ...}}}\\), which is an infinite nested radical.\n\n2. **Infinite Nested Radicals:** Recognize that the expression \\(\\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + \\sqrt{b + ...}}}\\) converges to a finite value. This can be represented by setting it equal to a variable, say \\(x\\), leading to an equation like \\(x = \\sqrt{b + x}\\).\n\n3. **Solving for the Variable:** When you have an equation like \\(x = \\sqrt{b + x}\\), square both sides to eliminate the square root. This will give you a quadratic equation in \\(x\\), which can be solved using standard methods.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the value of \\(g\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition (\\(7 \\bowtie g = 9\\)). This step ensures that your solution is correct and that no extraneous solutions were introduced during the solving process.\n\n5. **Careful with Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with nested radicals and solving quadratic equations, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
