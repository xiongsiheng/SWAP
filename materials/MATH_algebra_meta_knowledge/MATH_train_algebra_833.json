{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you can set up a system of linear equations based on the given pair-wise weights. Let \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) represent the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon respectively.\n\n2. **Formulate Equations:** From the given information, you can create the following equations: \\( A + B = 260 \\), \\( B + C = 245 \\), and \\( C + D = 270 \\).\n\n3. **Elimination Method:** Use the elimination method to solve for individual weights. Subtract one equation from another to eliminate variables and find the weight of one person.\n\n4. **Substitution:** Once you find the weight of one person, substitute it back into the equations to find the weights of the others.\n\n5. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy. Small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n6. **Final Verification:** After finding the individual weights, add the weights of Abby and Damon to verify if their combined weight matches the context of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
