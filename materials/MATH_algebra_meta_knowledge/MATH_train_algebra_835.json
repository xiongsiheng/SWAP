{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Order:** When substituting values into expressions, ensure you substitute in the correct order. For example, first find the value of \\(s\\) using the given \\(n\\), then use this \\(s\\) to find \\(r\\).\n\n2. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with exponents. Miscalculations in exponentiation can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Checking Intermediate Values:** Verify the intermediate values obtained after each substitution to ensure they are correct before proceeding to the next step.\n\n4. **Simplification Techniques:** Use proper simplification techniques for expressions involving exponents. For example, \\(a^{b+c} = a^b \\cdot a^c\\).\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the final value of \\(r\\), consider re-evaluating the expression from the beginning to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
