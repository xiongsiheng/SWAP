{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that the distances traveled each second form an arithmetic sequence, where each term decreases by a constant amount (in this case, 7 feet) from the previous term.\n\n2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:** Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \\), where \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the sequence, \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and \\( a_n \\) is the last term.\n\n3. **Finding the Number of Terms:** Determine the number of terms in the sequence by recognizing when the car stops, which is when the distance traveled becomes zero or negative. This can be found by setting up an equation where the distance equals zero and solving for \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Careful Calculations:** Be meticulous with your calculations, especially when dealing with subtraction and division, as these operations can lead to errors if not performed carefully.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the total distance, consider verifying your answer by manually summing the distances for the first few seconds to ensure consistency with your formula-derived result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
