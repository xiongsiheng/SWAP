{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Ensure that you factorize the numerators correctly. For example, recognizing that \\( y^2 - 9y + 8 \\) can be factored into \\( (y-1)(y-8) \\) is crucial.\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** When simplifying fractions, make sure to cancel terms correctly. Only factors common to both the numerator and the denominator can be cancelled out.\n\n3. **Avoiding Division by Zero:** Be aware of the values of \\( y \\) that would make the denominator zero, as these values are not valid solutions.\n\n4. **Combining Like Terms:** When combining fractions, ensure that you find a common denominator correctly and combine like terms accurately.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After solving for \\( y \\), substitute your solution back into the original equation to verify its correctness. This step helps catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors made during the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
