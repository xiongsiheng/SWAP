{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of sum involving complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Properties of \\(i\\):** Remember that \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit where \\(i^2 = -1\\). The powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four terms: \\(i, -1, -i, 1\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Powers:** Recognize patterns in the sum of powers of \\(i\\). For example, \\(i^n + i^{-n}\\) simplifies based on the cycle of powers.\n\n3. **Symmetry in Summation:** Notice the symmetry in the given series. Terms like \\(i^n\\) and \\(i^{-n}\\) often cancel out or simplify nicely.\n\n4. **Handling Large Exponents:** Use the cyclic nature of \\(i\\) to simplify large exponents. For instance, \\(i^{100} = (i^4)^{25} = 1^{25} = 1\\).\n\n5. **Verification of Simplifications:** After simplifying, verify your steps by checking if the simplified form matches the original terms in the series.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems involving sums of powers of \\(i\\)."}
