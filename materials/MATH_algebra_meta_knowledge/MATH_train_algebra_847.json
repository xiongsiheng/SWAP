{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of system of equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction Method:** When you have a system of equations where one equation can be added or subtracted from the other to eliminate a variable, use this method. In this case, adding the two equations will eliminate \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** Alternatively, you can solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other equation. For example, solve \\( x - y = 6 \\) for \\( x \\) and substitute into \\( x + y = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Check Your Calculations:** After finding the value of \\( x \\) or \\( y \\), substitute it back into one of the original equations to verify your solution.\n\n4. **Consistency:** Ensure that your final values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) satisfy both original equations to confirm the solution's correctness.\n\n5. **Avoid Rounding Errors:** If you encounter decimal numbers, avoid premature rounding which can lead to inaccurate results. Use exact values until the final step.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving systems of linear equations."}
