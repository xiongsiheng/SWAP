{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating the Equation:** Translate the problem statement into a mathematical equation accurately. For this problem, the equation would be \\( M(M - 6) = -5 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Recognize that you are dealing with a quadratic equation (\\( M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0 \\)). Use the quadratic formula \\( M = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) or factorize if possible.\n\n3. **Checking for Real Solutions:** Ensure that the discriminant (\\( b^2 - 4ac \\)) is non-negative to confirm real solutions.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots can be directly found using the relationship \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to verify they satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
