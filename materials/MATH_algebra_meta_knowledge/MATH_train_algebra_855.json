{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** When dealing with a problem that involves multiple variables and conditions, setting up a system of equations can help. In this case, you might use variables to represent the number of paperback and hardcover volumes.\n\n2. **Check Constraints:** Ensure that your solution adheres to all given constraints. For example, the total number of volumes must equal ten, and the total cost must equal $220.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning:** Use logical reasoning to narrow down possibilities. For instance, if the total cost is $220 and each hardcover costs $25, the number of hardcover volumes must be a factor of $220 divided by $25.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to your arithmetic and ensure that you are correctly calculating the total cost based on the number of each type of volume.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you have a solution, verify it by calculating the total cost using the number of paperback and hardcover volumes to ensure it matches the given total of $220.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
