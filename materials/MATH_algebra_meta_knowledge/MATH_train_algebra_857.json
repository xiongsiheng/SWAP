{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Remember that if two quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are inversely proportional, their product \\( xy \\) is a constant. This means \\( xy = k \\) for some constant \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given conditions to set up equations. In this case, you know \\( x + y = 42 \\) and \\( x = 2y \\). Solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Using the Constant Product:** Once you find the constant \\( k \\) from the initial conditions, use it to find the value of \\( y \\) when \\( x = -8 \\). This involves solving the equation \\( -8y = k \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations, as errors in these steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the value of \\( y \\), substitute it back into the inverse proportionality condition \\( xy = k \\) to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
