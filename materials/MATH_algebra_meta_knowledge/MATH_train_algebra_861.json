{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you substitute the correct coordinates into the formula. Misplacing coordinates can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Squaring Differences:** When calculating \\((x_2 - x_1)^2\\) and \\((y_2 - y_1)^2\\), remember to square both the difference in x-coordinates and the difference in y-coordinates separately before adding them.\n\n4. **Simplifying Radicals:** After calculating the expression under the square root, simplify the radical if possible. For example, if the expression under the square root is a perfect square, simplify it to a whole number.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations for both the differences and the square root to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
