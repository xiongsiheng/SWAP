{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to find the length of a line segment between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\): \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). Ensure you correctly substitute the coordinates into the formula.\n\n2. **Square Roots and Squares:** Be precise when calculating square roots and squaring numbers. Errors often occur in these operations.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** When solving for a variable, such as \\(x\\), ensure you isolate \\(x\\) correctly. Check your algebraic steps to avoid miscalculations.\n\n4. **Positive Constraints:** Since \\(x > 0\\), ensure your solution respects this constraint. If solving an equation yields multiple potential solutions, select the one that satisfies the given condition.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\(x\\), substitute it back into the context of the problem to verify that the line segment indeed has the correct length and meets the conditions specified.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
