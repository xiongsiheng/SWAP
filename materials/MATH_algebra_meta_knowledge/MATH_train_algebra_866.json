{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Asymptotes:** Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. Identify these points by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Factoring Techniques:** Use factoring techniques to simplify the denominator. Look for common factors or use the quadratic formula if necessary. Ensure that you correctly factor both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n3. **Checking for Holes:** A rational function can have a hole (removable discontinuity) at points where both the numerator and the denominator are zero for the same \\( x \\). This is not a vertical asymptote, so ensure you distinguish between holes and asymptotes.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic, especially when solving for \\( x \\) in the denominator. Small errors in calculation can lead to incorrect values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n5. **Summing Correctly:** After finding \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), add them together carefully. Ensure that you are adding the correct values and not mixing them up.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
