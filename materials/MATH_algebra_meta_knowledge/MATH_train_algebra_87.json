{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex numbers in the form of a fraction, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Multiplying by the Conjugate:** To eliminate the imaginary part from the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(1+2i\\) is \\(1-2i\\).\n\n2. **Distributing Correctly:** Ensure that you distribute correctly when multiplying the numerator and the denominator. This includes using the distributive property and correctly handling the multiplication of complex numbers.\n\n3. **Simplifying Imaginary Numbers:** Remember that \\(i^2 = -1\\). This is crucial when simplifying expressions that involve \\(i^2\\).\n\n4. **Combining Like Terms:** After multiplication, combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately in the numerator. The denominator should simplify to a real number.\n\n5. **Expressing in Standard Form:** Your final answer should be expressed in the form \\(a+bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers. Ensure that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are simplified to their simplest forms, possibly as improper fractions if necessary.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying complex numbers in fraction form."}
