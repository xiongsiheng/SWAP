{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Polynomial Addition:** When adding polynomials, add the coefficients of like terms. Ensure that you correctly identify and combine all like terms.\n\n2. **Isolating Polynomials:** To find one polynomial given the sum and one of the polynomials, subtract the known polynomial from the sum. This operation should be done term by term to avoid mistakes.\n\n3. **Checking Polynomial Degrees:** Be aware of the degrees of the polynomials involved. The degree of the resulting polynomial from an addition or subtraction operation will be determined by the highest degree term present in the original polynomials.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when subtracting polynomials, as errors in signs and coefficients can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting the found polynomial back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
