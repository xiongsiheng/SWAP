{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the distance between two points, which is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). Ensure you correctly substitute the coordinates into the formula.\n\n2. **Equidistant Points:** When a point is equidistant from two other points, the distances from the point to each of the two points must be equal. Set the distance equations equal to each other and solve for the unknown coordinate.\n\n3. **Simplification:** When squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, be careful with signs and ensure that the arithmetic is correct. This step is crucial as errors here can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\n4. **Focus on the x-coordinate:** Since the point is on the x-axis, its y-coordinate is 0. Focus only on the x-coordinate in your calculations and equations.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the x-coordinate, you can quickly verify by calculating the distances from the point (x, 0) to points A and B to ensure they are indeed equal.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
