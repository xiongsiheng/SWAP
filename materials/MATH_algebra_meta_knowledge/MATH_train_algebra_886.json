{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series:** The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series with first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) (where \\( |r| < 1 \\)) is given by \\( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \\).\n\n2. **Removing Terms from the Series:** When removing the first three terms of the series, the new series starts from the fourth term. The new first term is \\( ar^3 \\) and the sum of this new series is \\( \frac{ar^3}{1 - r} \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the given relationship between the original series and the modified series to set up an equation. In this case, the sum of the original series is 27 times the sum of the series after removing the first three terms.\n\n4. **Solving for the Common Ratio:** Simplify the equation by substituting the sum formulas and solve for \\( r \\). Ensure that the algebraic manipulations are correct to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Checking the Range of \\( r \\):** Verify that the common ratio \\( r \\) satisfies \\( |r| < 1 \\), as required for the series to converge.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
