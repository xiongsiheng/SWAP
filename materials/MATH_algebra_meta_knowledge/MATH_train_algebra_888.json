{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Geometric Series Formula:** Remember the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, which is \\(S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Common Ratio Calculation:** Calculate the common ratio \\(r\\) by dividing the second term by the first term. For the first series, \\(r = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n3. **Sum of the First Series:** Use the formula to find the sum of the first series: \\(S_1 = \\frac{12}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}} = 18\\).\n\n4. **Sum of the Second Series:** Since the second series has a sum four times that of the first series, its sum is \\(4 \\times 18 = 72\\).\n\n5. **Setting Up the Equation:** For the second series, use the sum formula again with the new second term: \\(S_2 = \\frac{12}{1 - r_2}\\), where \\(r_2\\) is the new common ratio. The second term is \\(4 + n\\), so \\(r_2 = \\frac{4 + n}{12}\\).\n\n6. **Solving for \\(n\\):** Equate the sum of the second series to 72 and solve for \\(n\\): \\(72 = \\frac{12}{1 - \\frac{4 + n}{12}}\\).\n\n7. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure all calculations are done accurately, especially when dealing with fractions and solving for \\(n\\).\n\n8. **Verification:** Double-check all steps and calculations to ensure the value of \\(n\\) is correct and consistent with the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
