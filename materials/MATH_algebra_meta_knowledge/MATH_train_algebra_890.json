{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating functions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the correct value into the function. In this case, replace every instance of \\( n \\) with 11.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression. This means first handle exponents, then multiplication or division, and finally addition or subtraction.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with larger numbers or when squaring a number, as these can be prone to calculation errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the calculations, double-check your work to ensure that each step was performed correctly.\n\n5. **Use of Calculator:** If using a calculator, ensure that you input the numbers and operations correctly to avoid any input errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating functions like \\( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \\)."}
