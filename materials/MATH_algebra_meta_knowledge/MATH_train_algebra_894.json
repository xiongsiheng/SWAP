{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to compose functions. For \\( g(f(x)) \\), substitute \\( f(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\). This means replacing \\( x \\) in \\( g(x) \\) with \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Equating Expressions:** When you have an equation involving composed functions, equate the expressions on both sides. For example, if \\( g(f(x)) = 3x + 4 \\), write out the full expression for \\( g(f(x)) \\) and set it equal to \\( 3x + 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Constants:** Isolate and solve for the constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) by comparing coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant terms on both sides of the equation.\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:** Ensure that the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) you find satisfy the original condition for all \\( x \\). This step helps verify that your solution is correct and consistent with the given problem statement.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with linear equations, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
