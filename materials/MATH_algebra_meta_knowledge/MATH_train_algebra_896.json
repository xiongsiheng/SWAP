{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Area Calculation:** Remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the area is given by \\((x - 2)(2x + 5) = 8x - 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding and Simplifying:** When you expand the product of two binomials, use the distributive property carefully to avoid errors. For example, \\((x - 2)(2x + 5)\\) expands to \\(2x^2 + 5x - 4x - 10 = 2x^2 + x - 10\\).\n\n3. **Equating and Solving:** Set the expanded form equal to the given area \\(8x - 6\\) and solve the resulting quadratic equation. Ensure that you correctly identify and solve for \\(x\\) by factoring or using the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving for \\(x\\), check if the dimensions \\(x - 2\\) and \\(2x + 5\\) make sense (i.e., they should be positive lengths for a rectangle). Substitute the value of \\(x\\) back into the original dimensions to verify.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with signs and coefficients, as these can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
