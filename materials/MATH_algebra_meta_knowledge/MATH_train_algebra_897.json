{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Degree of Polynomials:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, the degree of \\(3z^2 + 2z + 1\\) is 2.\n\n2. **Addition of Polynomials:** When adding two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is determined by the polynomial with the highest degree, provided the degrees are not the same. If the degrees are the same, the leading coefficients could cancel out, potentially reducing the degree.\n\n3. **Leading Coefficient Consideration:** If the degrees of the polynomials being added are the same, check the leading coefficients to see if they cancel each other out. This is not the case in your problem since the degree of \\(g(z)\\) is less than the degree of \\(f(z)\\).\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Always verify your understanding by considering simple examples. For instance, if \\(f(z) = z^2 + 3z + 2\\) and \\(g(z) = z + 1\\), then \\(f(z) + g(z) = z^2 + 4z + 3\\), which still has a degree of 2.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
