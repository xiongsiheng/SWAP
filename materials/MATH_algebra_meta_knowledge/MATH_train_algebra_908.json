{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you are dealing with a system of linear equations. Each line represents an equation that can be used to solve for the values of the triangles (\u0394) and circles (\u25cb).\n\n2. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve for the values of \u0394 and \u25cb. This involves adding or subtracting the equations to isolate one variable.\n\n3. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the values you derive for \u0394 and \u25cb are consistent across all equations. Substitute these values back into the original equations to verify their correctness.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the variables. Small arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:** Once you have determined the values of \u0394 and \u25cb, perform the final calculation for the sum of three circles (\u25cb + \u25cb + \u25cb) carefully to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
