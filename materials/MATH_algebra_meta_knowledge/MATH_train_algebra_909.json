{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Slope:** Recognize that the relationship between the changes in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values is described by the slope of the line. The slope \\( m \\) is given by the ratio of the change in \\( y \\) to the change in \\( x \\), i.e., \\( m = \frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\).\n\n2. **Proportionality:** Since the slope is constant, the changes in \\( y \\) are directly proportional to the changes in \\( x \\). This means if \\( \\Delta x \\) changes by a factor, \\( \\Delta y \\) will change by the same factor.\n\n3. **Applying the Slope:** Use the given information to calculate the slope. In this case, the slope is \\( \frac{7}{3} \\). When \\( x \\) increases by 9 units, which is 3 times the original increase of 3 units, the \\( y \\)-value will increase by 3 times the original increase of 7 units.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that you correctly apply the proportional relationship and slope calculations. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n5. **Consistency:** Ensure that your final answer is consistent with the proportional relationship described by the slope. This will help verify the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
