{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Inequality:** Recognize that the inequality $-x^2 + bx - 5 < 0$ represents a parabola opening downwards. The intervals where the inequality holds True indicate the regions outside the roots of the quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Finding the Roots:** Determine the roots of the quadratic equation $-x^2 + bx - 5 = 0$ using the quadratic formula or by factoring, if possible. The roots will help identify the intervals where the inequality is satisfied.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Intervals:** The given intervals $x \\in (-\\infty, 1) \\cup (5, \\infty)$ suggest that the quadratic has roots at $x = 1$ and $x = 5$. This information can be used to set up equations for $b$.\n\n4. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the fact that the roots of the quadratic equation are $1$ and $5$ to form the equation $-x^2 + bx - 5 = -(x - 1)(x - 5)$. Expanding this will give you an equation to solve for $b$.\n\n5. **Solving for $b$:** From the expanded form, equate the coefficients of $x$ to find $b$. This step involves careful algebraic manipulation to isolate $b$.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you have a value for $b$, substitute it back into the original inequality to ensure it satisfies the given intervals.\n\nThese steps should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
