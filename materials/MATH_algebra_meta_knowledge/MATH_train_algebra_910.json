{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the average of the solutions of a quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) for an equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). This formula directly gives the two solutions.\n\n2. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots (solutions) is given by \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\). The average of the solutions is half of this sum.\n\n3. **Discriminant:** Ensure that the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) is non-negative for the equation to have real solutions. This is a crucial check before proceeding to find the solutions.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Be meticulous in simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots. Errors often occur in these steps.\n\n5. **Verification:** Although not always necessary, it can be helpful to verify the sum of the roots using the derived solutions to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the average of the solutions of a quadratic equation."}
