{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Identify the equations based on the given conditions. In this case, you have three unknowns (x, y, z) and three conditions that can be translated into equations.\n\n2. **Logical Sequence:** Solve the equations step by step, starting from the simplest or most straightforward equation. This helps in systematically reducing the number of variables.\n\n3. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve for each variable. Substitute known values into other equations to find the unknowns.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the values of x, y, and z, verify that they satisfy all the original conditions given in the problem. This step ensures that your solution is correct.\n\n6. **Final Calculation:** After confirming the values of x, y, and z, calculate the product of these numbers carefully to get the final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
