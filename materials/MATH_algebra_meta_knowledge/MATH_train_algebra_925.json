{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Equation of a Circle:** Recognize that the given equation might need to be rearranged into the standard form of a circle equation, \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** Use the method of completing the square to transform the given quadratic equation into the standard form of a circle.\n\n3. **Understanding Inscribed Shapes:** When a circle is inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle equals the side length of the square. This relationship is crucial for finding the area of the square.\n\n4. **Calculating the Area:** Once you have determined the side length of the square (which is twice the radius of the circle), square this length to find the area.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and squaring operations, as these can introduce errors if not handled carefully.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
