{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation involving complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Isolate Variables:** Start by isolating the variable of interest, in this case, \\( z \\). Move all terms involving \\( z \\) to one side of the equation and constants to the other side.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** When you have terms involving \\( z \\) on both sides, combine them. This might involve adding or subtracting terms that include \\( z \\).\n\n3. **Factor Out Variables:** If necessary, factor out the variable \\( z \\) from the terms on one side of the equation to simplify further.\n\n4. **Divide by Coefficient:** Once you have isolated \\( z \\), divide by the coefficient of \\( z \\) to solve for \\( z \\). Be careful with the arithmetic, especially when dealing with complex coefficients.\n\n5. **Standard Form:** Ensure that your final answer is in standard form, typically \\( a + bi \\) for complex numbers, where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving equations involving complex numbers."}
