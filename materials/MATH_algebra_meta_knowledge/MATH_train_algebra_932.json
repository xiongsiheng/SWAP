{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inequalities:** Recognize that solving an inequality involves finding the values of \\( x \\) for which the expression is either less than, greater than, or not equal to a given value.\n\n2. **Quadratic Inequalities:** For quadratic inequalities like \\( ax^2 + bx + c > d \\), first rewrite it as \\( ax^2 + bx + c - d > 0 \\). Then, solve the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c - d = 0 \\) to find the roots.\n\n3. **Factoring and Quadratic Formula:** Use factoring techniques or the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the roots of the quadratic equation.\n\n4. **Sign Analysis:** Perform a sign analysis of the quadratic expression between its roots to determine where the expression is positive or negative.\n\n5. **Integer Solutions:** Focus on finding the integer values of \\( x \\) that lie within the intervals determined by the sign analysis.\n\n6. **Double-Check Intervals:** Ensure that you correctly identify the intervals where the inequality is not satisfied, and count only the integer values within those intervals.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
