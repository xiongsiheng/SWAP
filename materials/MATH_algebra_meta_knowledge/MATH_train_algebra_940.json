{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the correct formula for compound interest, which is \\(A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the future amount, \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate, \\(n\\) is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and \\(t\\) is the number of years.\n\n2. **Annual Compounding:** Since the interest is compounded annually, \\(n = 1\\), simplifying the formula to \\(A = P \\left(1 + r\\right)^t\\).\n\n3. **Solving for Principal:** Rearrange the formula to solve for \\(P\\): \\(P = \\frac{A}{(1 + r)^t}\\).\n\n4. **Interest Rate Conversion:** Ensure the interest rate \\(r\\) is expressed as a decimal (e.g., 5% becomes 0.05).\n\n5. **Rounding Correctly:** Round the final answer to the nearest cent as specified in the problem.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and divisions, to avoid computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
