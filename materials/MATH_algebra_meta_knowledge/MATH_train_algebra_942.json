{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of the first six terms in a geometric sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio:** Determine the common ratio (r) by dividing any term by the previous term. In this case, the common ratio is \\(\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Use the Sum Formula:** The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula \\(S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Correct Exponentiation:** Ensure that you correctly calculate \\(r^n\\), especially when \\(n\\) is larger. For this problem, \\(r^6 = (\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64}\\).\n\n4. **Simplify Carefully:** When simplifying the sum formula, pay close attention to the order of operations and fractions. Combine and simplify fractions step by step to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After finding the sum, double-check your calculations, especially the arithmetic involved in the formula, to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
