{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of the given expression, consider the following:\n\n1. **Non-Negative Radicands:** The radicands (the expressions under the square roots) must be non-negative. This means \\(x - 2 \\geq 0\\) and \\(5 - x \\geq 0\\).\n\n2. **Denominator Non-Zero:** The denominator of a fraction cannot be zero, so \\(\\sqrt{5 - x} \\neq 0\\), which implies \\(5 - x \\neq 0\\).\n\n3. **Combining Inequalities:** Solve the inequalities \\(x - 2 \\geq 0\\) and \\(5 - x \\geq 0\\) simultaneously to find the range of \\(x\\) that satisfies both conditions.\n\n4. **Intersection of Solutions:** The domain is the intersection of the solutions to these inequalities, ensuring that both the numerator and the denominator are defined and the denominator is not zero.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the domain of the expression."}
