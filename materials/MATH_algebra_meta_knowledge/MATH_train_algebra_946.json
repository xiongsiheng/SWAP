{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving simple interest, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Simple Interest:** Simple interest is calculated as \\(I = P \times R \times T\\), where \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(R\\) is the interest rate per period, and \\(T\\) is the time in the same units as the rate.\n\n2. **Interest Rate Conversion:** Ensure that the interest rate is correctly converted to a decimal or fraction for calculation. For example, a 15% rate should be used as 0.15 in the formula.\n\n3. **Total Amount Calculation:** The total amount to be paid back includes both the principal and the interest. It is calculated as \\(A = P + I\\).\n\n4. **Setting Up the Inequality:** To find the least number of days after which the amount doubles, set up an inequality where the total amount \\(A\\) is at least twice the principal \\(P\\).\n\n5. **Solving for Time:** Solve the inequality for the time \\(T\\) in days, ensuring that the result is rounded up to the next whole number, as partial days do not count in this context.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations by substituting the time back into the formula to ensure the amount does indeed double or exceed the original amount.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving simple interest calculations."}
