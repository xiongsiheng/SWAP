{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For \\( f(g(x)) \\), first evaluate \\( g(x) \\) and then use the result as the input for \\( f(x) \\). Similarly, for \\( g(f(x)) \\), first evaluate \\( f(x) \\) and then use the result as the input for \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values into functions, ensure you substitute correctly. For example, if you need to find \\( f(g(5)) \\), first calculate \\( g(5) \\) and then substitute this result into \\( f(x) \\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions, especially when dealing with polynomials and linear functions.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as these can lead to errors if not performed accurately.\n\n5. **Double-Check Results:** After calculating \\( f(g(5)) \\) and \\( g(f(5)) \\), double-check your calculations to ensure they are correct before subtracting the two results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
