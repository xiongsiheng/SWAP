{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cubing Both Sides:** When you cube both sides of an equation to eliminate the cube root, ensure that the operations are performed correctly. This step is crucial as it directly affects the solution.\n\n2. **Handling Fractions:** Be meticulous when dealing with fractions, especially when they are part of an expression under a radical. Simplifying these expressions correctly is key to finding the correct solution.\n\n3. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, verify that the solution does not make the original expression undefined (e.g., by causing division by zero). This is particularly important when dealing with expressions involving fractions.\n\n4. **Substitution Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to confirm that it satisfies the equation. This step helps in identifying any errors made during the solving process.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and values, especially when dealing with negative numbers and their cubes, as these can lead to common mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
