{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex of a Parabola:** The vertex of a parabola given by \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is located at \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\). For the parabola \\( y = x^2 + a^2 \\), the vertex is at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = a^2 \\).\n\n2. **Intersection of Line and Parabola:** To find if the line \\( y = x + a \\) passes through the vertex of the parabola, set the coordinates of the vertex equal to the equation of the line. This means setting \\( a^2 = 0 + a \\).\n\n3. **Solving Equations:** When solving equations like \\( a^2 = a \\), remember to consider both the positive and negative roots. This equation can be rewritten as \\( a^2 - a = 0 \\), which factors to \\( a(a - 1) = 0 \\), giving solutions \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( a = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Always verify that the solutions satisfy the original conditions by substituting them back into the equations to ensure they correctly represent the intersections.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
