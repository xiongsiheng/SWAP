{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving complex numbers, particularly powers of the imaginary unit \\(i\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cyclical Nature of \\(i\\):** The powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four terms: \\(i^1 = i\\), \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), \\(i^4 = 1\\), and then the cycle repeats. This means \\(i^n\\) can be determined by finding the remainder of \\(n\\) divided by 4.\n\n2. **Simplifying Large Exponents:** To simplify \\(i^n\\) where \\(n\\) is large, divide \\(n\\) by 4 and use the remainder to determine the value of \\(i^n\\). For example, if \\(n = 22\\), then \\(22 \\div 4 = 5\\) remainder \\(2\\), so \\(i^{22} = i^2 = -1\\).\n\n3. **Adding Complex Numbers:** When adding complex numbers, add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together. In this case, since \\(i^{22}\\) and \\(i^{222}\\) are both real (due to the cyclical nature of \\(i\\)), simply add the resulting real numbers.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you correctly calculate the remainders and apply the cyclical nature of \\(i\\) accurately. Missteps in these calculations can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by checking if the sum of the simplified powers of \\(i\\) matches the expected pattern or result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating expressions involving powers of the imaginary unit \\(i\\)."}
