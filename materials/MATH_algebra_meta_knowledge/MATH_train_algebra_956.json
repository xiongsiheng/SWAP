{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Consecutive Integers:** Consecutive integers are integers that follow each other in order, such as 1 and 2, or 15 and 16. They can be represented as \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\).\n\n2. **Formulating the Problem:** Express the product of two consecutive integers mathematically. For integers \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\), their product is \\( n(n+1) \\).\n\n3. **Inequality Setup:** Set up an inequality where the product \\( n(n+1) \\) is less than 400. This will help in finding the range of \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Solving the Inequality:** Solve the inequality \\( n(n+1) < 400 \\) to find the maximum integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition. This involves finding the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation \\( n^2 + n - 400 = 0 \\) and determining the appropriate integer values.\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:** Once you have determined the maximum \\( n \\), calculate the sum of \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\). This sum represents the greatest possible sum of two consecutive integers whose product is less than 400.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with inequalities and quadratic equations.\n\nThese steps will help ensure you approach the problem systematically and minimize errors."}
