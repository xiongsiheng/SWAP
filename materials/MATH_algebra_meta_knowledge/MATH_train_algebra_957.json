{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the compound interest formula to calculate the final amount: \\( A = P(1 + r)^n \\), where \\( A \\) is the final amount, \\( P \\) is the principal amount, \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate, and \\( n \\) is the number of years.\n\n2. **Interest Calculation:** To find the interest earned, subtract the principal amount from the final amount: \\( \text{Interest} = A - P \\).\n\n3. **Rate Conversion:** Ensure that the interest rate is in decimal form. For example, a 1% rate should be written as 0.01.\n\n4. **Rounding:** When rounding to the nearest dollar, follow standard rounding rules: round up if the decimal is 0.5 or greater, and round down if it is less than 0.5.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Make sure all units are consistent; for instance, if the interest rate is annual, the number of years should also be in annual terms.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
