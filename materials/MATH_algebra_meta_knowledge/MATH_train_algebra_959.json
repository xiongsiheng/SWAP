{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value of \\( x \\) correctly into the expression. In this case, replace \\( x \\) with 3.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating the expression. For \\( 2x + 3 \\), multiply \\( 2 \\) by \\( 3 \\) first, then add \\( 3 \\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially multiplication and addition, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the operations, double-check your calculations to ensure they are correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
