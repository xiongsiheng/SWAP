{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Forms:** Recognize that \\(4^2\\) can be rewritten as \\(2^4\\) because \\(4 = 2^2\\). This simplifies the comparison between the two sides of the equation.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When you have an equation of the form \\(a^{f(x)} = a^{g(x)}\\), you can equate \\(f(x) = g(x)\\). This is based on the property that if the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Once you equate the exponents, solve the resulting linear equation carefully. Ensure that you correctly handle the arithmetic operations involved.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After finding the value of \\(x\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step helps catch any arithmetic or conceptual errors made during the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
