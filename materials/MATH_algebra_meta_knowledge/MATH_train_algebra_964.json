{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where the equation is in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). Identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly to apply the formula.\n\n2. **Discriminant:** Calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to determine the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).\n\n3. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\). This can be a shortcut to find the sum without needing to solve for each root individually.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the roots, substitute them back into the original equation to verify they satisfy the equation.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure precise arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers or complex expressions, to avoid computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations."}
