{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Relationships:** Clearly define the relationships between variables. In this case, \\(a = 3b\\), \\(b = 2c\\), and \\(c = 4d\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Use substitution to express all variables in terms of a single variable. For example, express \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) in terms of \\(d\\).\n\n3. **Simplification:** After substituting, simplify the expression step by step. Ensure that each step is logically correct and that you are not skipping any steps.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when multiplying or dividing, as these operations can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have your final answer, verify it by substituting back into the original relationships to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
