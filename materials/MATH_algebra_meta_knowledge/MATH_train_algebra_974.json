{"Knowledge": "To determine the radius of a circle given its equation in the form \\(x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\\), follow these steps to reduce errors:\n\n1. **Complete the Square:** Rewrite the equation by completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms. This involves grouping the \\(x\\) terms together and the \\(y\\) terms together, then adding and subtracting appropriate constants to form perfect squares.\n\n2. **Identify the Center:** After completing the square, the equation will be in the form \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center of the circle.\n\n3. **Determine the Radius:** The radius \\(r\\) of the circle is the square root of the constant term on the right side of the equation after completing the square.\n\n4. **Check the Equation Form:** Ensure that the final equation matches the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\).\n\n5. **Verify Calculations:** Double-check all algebraic manipulations and arithmetic calculations to avoid errors, especially when dealing with signs and squares.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the radius of the circle described by the given equation."}
