{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** Understand the piecewise function definition clearly. Identify which part of the function applies to each input value based on the given conditions.\n\n2. **Correct Segment Usage:** Ensure that you are using the correct segment of the function for each input. This involves correctly interpreting the inequalities and boundary conditions.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when calculating values from different segments of the function. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Boundary Conditions:** Be aware of how the function behaves at the boundaries (e.g., \\(x = -5\\) and \\(x = 5\\)) to ensure you are applying the correct function segment.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the values for each segment, sum them up and verify if the result makes sense logically, considering the function's behavior across different segments.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
