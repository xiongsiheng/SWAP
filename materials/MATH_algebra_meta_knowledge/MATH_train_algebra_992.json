{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio (common ratio). For example, in the sequence 2, 6, 18, the common ratio is 3.\n\n2. **Distinct Digits:** Ensure that all digits in the number are distinct. This means no digit should repeat within the number.\n\n3. **Formulating the Problem:** Express the three-digit number in terms of its digits. For instance, if the digits are \\(a\\), \\(ar\\), and \\(ar^2\\), where \\(a\\) is the first digit and \\(r\\) is the common ratio, ensure \\(a\\) and \\(r\\) are integers that satisfy the conditions of distinct digits and the number being a three-digit integer.\n\n4. **Maximizing the Number:** To find the largest number, start with the highest possible first digit (9) and adjust the common ratio \\(r\\) to ensure the digits remain distinct and within the range of 0-9.\n\n5. **Checking All Possibilities:** Consider all possible values for \\(r\\) (2, 3, etc.) and calculate the corresponding digits to find the largest valid number.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you have a candidate number, verify that its digits form a geometric sequence and are distinct. This step ensures the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
