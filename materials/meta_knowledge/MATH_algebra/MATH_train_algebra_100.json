{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand the conditions given: the total number of band members is less than 100, there are two members left over in the initial formation, and the new formation accommodates all members when the number of members per row is increased by 1 and the number of rows is decreased by 2.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use variables to represent the number of members per row (m) and the number of rows (r). Set up equations based on the given conditions, such as the total number of members being \\(mr + 2\\) and the new formation being \\((m+1)(r-2)\\).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Solve the equations simultaneously to find the values of m and r. This may involve trial and error within the constraint that the total number of members is less than 100.\n\n4. **Checking Constraints:** Ensure that the solutions satisfy all given constraints, including the integer nature of m and r, and the total number of members being less than 100.\n\n5. **Maximizing the Solution:** Since the problem asks for the largest number of members, check all valid solutions to find the maximum number.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
