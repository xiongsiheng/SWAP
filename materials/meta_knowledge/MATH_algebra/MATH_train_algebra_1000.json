{"Knowledge": "To determine the degree of a polynomial, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Each Term:** Break down the polynomial into individual terms.\n\n2. **Determine the Degree of Each Term:** The degree of a term is the exponent of the variable in that term. For example, the term \\(5x^3\\) has a degree of 3.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Degree:** The degree of the polynomial is the highest degree among all its terms. This is because the highest degree term dominates the polynomial's behavior as the variable approaches infinity.\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms:** Before determining the degree, ensure that like terms are combined. For example, \\(2\\pi x^4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{10}x^4\\) are like terms and can be combined.\n\n5. **Ignore Constants:** Constants (terms without a variable) do not affect the degree of the polynomial.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the degree of any polynomial."}
