{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Clearly define variables for the number of days worked and not worked. For example, let \\( x \\) be the number of days worked and \\( y \\) be the number of days not worked.\n\n2. **Formulating Relationships:** Use the given information to form equations. In this case, you know \\( x + y = 20 \\) (total days) and \\( 60x - 30y = 660 \\) (total earnings).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Solve the system of equations accurately. Ensure that you substitute correctly and perform algebraic manipulations without errors.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic steps, especially when dealing with negative numbers and multiplications.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), substitute them back into both original equations to ensure they satisfy both conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
