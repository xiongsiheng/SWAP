{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the center of a circle given its equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Circle's Equation:** Recognize that the standard form of a circle's equation is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** To convert the given equation into the standard form, you need to complete the square for both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms. This involves adding and subtracting appropriate constants to form perfect square trinomials.\n\n3. **Identifying the Center:** Once the equation is in the standard form, the center \\((h, k)\\) can be directly read off from the equation.\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Common errors include incorrect calculations when completing the square and misreading the signs of \\(h\\) and \\(k\\). Double-check these steps to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can substitute the coordinates of the center back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
