{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) correctly into the expression.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating the expression. This means raising to powers before multiplication and division, and then performing addition and subtraction.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with exponents and fractions, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each step is correct before moving on to the next.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Optionally, double-check the final answer by re-evaluating the expression with the given values to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
