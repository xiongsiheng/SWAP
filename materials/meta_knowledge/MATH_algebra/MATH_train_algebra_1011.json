{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the correct formula for compound interest, which is \\(A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(n\\) years, including interest; \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money); \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal); \\(n\\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year; and \\(t\\) is the number of years the money is invested.\n\n2. **Interest Rate Conversion:** Ensure that the annual interest rate is converted to a decimal form (e.g., \\(7\\%\\) becomes \\(0.07\\)).\n\n3. **Time Periods:** Be precise with the number of compounding periods. For quarterly compounding, \\(n = 4\\), and the total number of periods over 5 years is \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\n4. **Rounding Off:** When rounding to the nearest dollar, ensure you round correctly. Typically, this involves rounding to the nearest whole number based on the value of the first decimal place.\n\n5. **Substitution and Calculation:** Double-check the substitution of values into the formula and the calculations to avoid arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with exponents and complex arithmetic operations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
