{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** The center of a circle, given the endpoints of a diameter, is the midpoint of those endpoints. The formula for the midpoint \\((x_m, y_m)\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(x_m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\\) and \\(y_m = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Coordinate Addition:** When calculating the sum of the coordinates of the center, simply add the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately.\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations when applying the midpoint formula, as errors in division or addition can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Double-Check Results:** Verify the coordinates of the center by ensuring they are indeed the midpoint of the given endpoints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
