{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that function composition involves applying one function to the result of another. In this case, you need to find \\( f(-2) \\) first, then use that result as the input for \\( g \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating functions. Start by substituting the input value into the innermost function, then proceed to the next function.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and exponents. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify expressions step by step to avoid mistakes. For example, when evaluating \\( f(x) = x^3 + 3 \\), first cube the input, then add 3.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After finding the final answer, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy. This step can help catch any errors made during the evaluation process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
