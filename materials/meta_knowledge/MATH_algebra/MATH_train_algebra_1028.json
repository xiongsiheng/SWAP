{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rates:** Recognize that the rate at which water is dispensed by the faucets is constant. This means that the rate of filling the tub can be calculated based on the given information.\n\n2. **Proportional Reasoning:** Understand that the time taken to fill a tub is inversely proportional to the number of faucets. If the number of faucets doubles, the time taken to fill the same volume of water is halved, assuming the rate of water flow remains constant.\n\n3. **Unit Conversion:** Ensure that you convert the final answer into the correct units (seconds in this case). Remember that 1 minute equals 60 seconds.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to your calculations, especially when dealing with proportions and unit conversions, as these steps are critical and prone to errors.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure that your final answer makes logical sense. For example, if doubling the number of faucets results in a significantly longer time, there is likely an error in your reasoning or calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
