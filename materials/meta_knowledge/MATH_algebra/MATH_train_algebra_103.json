{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the coefficient of a specific term in the expansion of a product of polynomials, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Collect Like Terms:** After distributing, collect all terms that result in the desired power of \\(x\\). For the \\(x^2\\) term, this involves summing all products where the powers of \\(x\\) add up to 2.\n\n3. **Careful Multiplication:** Pay close attention to the coefficients and signs during multiplication to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Systematic Approach:** Work systematically to ensure that you do not miss any combinations of terms that contribute to the desired \\(x^2\\) term.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After finding the coefficient, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially in handling signs and coefficients.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
