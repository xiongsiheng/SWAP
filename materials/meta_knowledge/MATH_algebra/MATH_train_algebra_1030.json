{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Properties:** Recognize that the given function \\( f(2x) = 2f(x) \\) indicates a scaling property. This suggests that \\( f \\) might be an exponential function or similar, where the output doubles when the input is doubled.\n\n2. **Inverse Function Logic:** When dealing with the inverse function \\( f^{-1} \\), remember that \\( f^{-1}(y) = x \\) means \\( f(x) = y \\). This relationship is crucial for finding the inverse values.\n\n3. **Recursive Application:** Apply the given functional equation recursively to express \\( f(x) \\) in terms of known values, such as \\( f(3) = 1 \\). This can help in understanding how \\( f \\) behaves over different inputs.\n\n4. **Substitution and Solving:** Use substitution to express \\( f(x) \\) in terms of the given value \\( f(3) = 1 \\), and solve for the specific value \\( f^{-1}(64) \\). This involves finding \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 64 \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( f^{-1}(64) \\), verify by checking if \\( f \\) of the found value indeed equals 64. This step ensures the correctness of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
