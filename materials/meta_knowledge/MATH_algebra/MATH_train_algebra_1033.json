{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula for the roots of \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), which is \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). This formula is essential for finding the roots of the given quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Difference of Roots:** The difference between the roots of a quadratic equation can be expressed as \\(\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute the given difference of the roots into the formula for the difference of roots and simplify the expression to find \\(k\\). Ensure that you correctly handle the square root and algebraic manipulations.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and algebraic expressions, to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Maximizing \\(k\\):** Since the problem asks for the greatest possible value of \\(k\\), ensure that you correctly interpret and solve for \\(k\\) in a way that maximizes its value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
