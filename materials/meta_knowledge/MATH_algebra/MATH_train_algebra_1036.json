{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** When dealing with fractions on both sides of an equation, cross-multiplying can help simplify the equation. Remember that if you have \\(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}\\), then \\(ad = bc\\).\n\n2. **Square Both Sides:** To eliminate the square roots, you might need to square both sides of the equation. Be cautious as this can introduce extraneous solutions, so always verify the solutions in the original equation.\n\n3. **Simplifying Radicals:** Ensure that you simplify radicals correctly. For example, \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b}\\) is \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\), but \\(\\sqrt{a + b}\\) is not \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}\\).\n\n4. **Solving Linear Equations:** After simplifying, you might end up with a linear equation. Solve these by isolating the variable, ensuring you correctly handle coefficients and constants.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
