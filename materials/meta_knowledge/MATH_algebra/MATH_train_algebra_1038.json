{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Quadratics:** Factor the quadratic expression correctly. For example, \\(n^2 - 11n + 24\\) can be factored into \\((n - 3)(n - 8)\\).\n\n2. **Solving Inequalities:** When solving quadratic inequalities, determine the roots of the equation \\(n^2 - 11n + 24 = 0\\) first. The roots will help you identify the intervals to test.\n\n3. **Testing Intervals:** After identifying the roots (in this case, \\(n = 3\\) and \\(n = 8\\)), test the intervals around these roots (i.e., \\(n < 3\\), \\(3 < n < 8\\), and \\(n > 8\\)) to see where the inequality holds True.\n\n4. **Integer Solutions:** Since the problem asks for the greatest integer \\(n\\), ensure you find the highest integer within the interval where the inequality is satisfied.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your factoring and interval testing calculations to avoid arithmetic errors, which are common in solving quadratic inequalities.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
