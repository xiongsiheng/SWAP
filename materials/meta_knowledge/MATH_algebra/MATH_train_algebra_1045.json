{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Conjugate Multiplication:** When the denominator contains a difference of square roots or a square root minus a number (like \\(\\sqrt{2} - 1\\)), multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(\\sqrt{2} - 1\\) is \\(\\sqrt{2} + 1\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Products:** After multiplying by the conjugate, simplify the products in the numerator and the denominator. Use the difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the terms in the conjugate pairs.\n\n3. **Exact Algebraic Manipulations:** Ensure that all algebraic manipulations are exact and correct. Pay special attention to signs and coefficients.\n\n4. **Final Simplification:** After rationalizing, simplify the fraction to its simplest form by canceling out any common factors between the numerator and the denominator.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by substituting a value into the original expression and the simplified expression to ensure they yield the same result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while rationalizing denominators."}
