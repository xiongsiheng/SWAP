{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating the Equation:** Translate the problem into a mathematical equation. For this problem, let the integer be \\( x \\). The equation would be \\( x^2 = x + 182 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). Here, it becomes \\( x^2 - x - 182 = 0 \\). Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the roots.\n\n3. **Factoring:** Alternatively, try to factor the quadratic equation if possible. For \\( x^2 - x - 182 = 0 \\), look for two numbers that multiply to -182 and add to -1.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions satisfy the original equation by substituting them back into \\( x^2 = x + 182 \\).\n\n5. **Sum of Roots:** If you need to find the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), use the property that the sum of the roots is \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n6. **Integer Solutions:** Verify that the solutions are integers, as the problem specifies integers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
