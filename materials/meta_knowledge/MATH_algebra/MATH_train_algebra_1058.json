{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the maximum height of a parabolic path given by a quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Quadratic Equations:** Recognize that the given expression $-16t^2 + 64t + 31$ is a quadratic equation of the form $at^2 + bt + c$, where $a = -16$, $b = 64$, and $c = 31$.\n\n2. **Vertex Formula:** The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic equation $at^2 + bt + c$ occurs at the vertex, which can be found using the formula $t = -b / (2a)$. This formula gives the time at which the maximum height occurs.\n\n3. **Substituting to Find Height:** Once you have the time $t$ at the vertex, substitute this value back into the original quadratic equation to find the maximum height.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for finding $t$ and substituting back into the equation to ensure accuracy, as errors in these steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Graphical Understanding:** Optionally, understanding the parabolic nature of the graph can help visualize the problem, but the algebraic approach using the vertex formula is typically more straightforward and less prone to errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the maximum height in parabolic path problems."}
