{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating average speed, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Time Calculation:** Accurately calculate the total time spent driving by subtracting the starting time from the ending time, ensuring you handle minutes correctly by converting them to fractions of an hour if necessary.\n\n2. **Speed Formula:** Use the correct formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time (\\( \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\)).\n\n3. **Unit Consistency:** Ensure that both the distance and the time are in compatible units (miles and hours). If time is given in minutes, convert it to hours before performing the division.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform all arithmetic calculations with precision to avoid rounding errors that can significantly affect the final result.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After calculating the average speed, double-check your arithmetic and conversions to confirm the accuracy of your answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating average speed in such problems."}
