{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Domain:** The domain of a rational expression includes all real numbers except those that make the denominator zero. To ensure the expression has a domain of all real numbers, the denominator must not have real roots.\n\n2. **Quadratic Discriminant:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) to have no real roots, its discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be less than zero.\n\n3. **Maximizing \\(b\\):** To find the greatest integer value of \\(b\\), you need to set the discriminant of the quadratic in the denominator less than zero and solve the inequality for \\(b\\).\n\n4. **Inequality Solving:** When solving inequalities, especially involving squares and square roots, ensure you handle the direction of the inequality correctly, especially when multiplying or dividing by negative numbers.\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining the value of \\(b\\), verify by substituting it back into the quadratic to confirm it does not have real roots, thus ensuring the expression's domain includes all real numbers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
