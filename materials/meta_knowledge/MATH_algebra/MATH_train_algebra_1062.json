{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the midpoint between two points, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Use the midpoint formula, which is given by \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Correct Addition:** Ensure that you correctly add the corresponding coordinates of the two points. For example, add the x-coordinates together and the y-coordinates together separately.\n\n3. **Division by 2:** After adding the coordinates, divide each sum by 2 to find the average. This step is crucial as it determines the exact midpoint.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the midpoint by checking if it is equidistant from both original points, though this is less common for simple midpoint calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the midpoint between two points."}
