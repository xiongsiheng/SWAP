{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the equation of a line and calculating the sum of the slope and y-intercept, consider the following:\n\n1. **Slope-Intercept Form:** Recall that the equation of a line in slope-intercept form is \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Using a Point:** To find \\( b \\), substitute the given point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) into the equation \\( y = mx + b \\). For example, if the point is \\((3, 0)\\), substitute \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) into the equation.\n\n3. **Substitution and Solving:** After substituting the point, solve for \\( b \\). For instance, \\( 0 = -7(3) + b \\) simplifies to \\( b = 21 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating \\( m + b \\):** Once you have both \\( m \\) and \\( b \\), simply add them together. In this case, \\( m = -7 \\) and \\( b = 21 \\), so \\( m + b = -7 + 21 \\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are correct, especially when substituting and solving for \\( b \\). A simple mistake in arithmetic can lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\nBy following these steps and being meticulous with calculations, you can minimize errors in solving this type of problem."}
