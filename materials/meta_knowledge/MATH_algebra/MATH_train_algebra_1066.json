{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Circle Equation:** Recognize that the standard form of a circle's equation is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n2. **Rearranging and Completing the Square:** To convert the given equation into the standard form, you may need to rearrange terms and complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms.\n\n3. **Accuracy in Completing the Square:** Ensure that you correctly complete the square for both variables. This involves adding and subtracting the correct values to form perfect squares.\n\n4. **Identifying the Center and Radius:** Once the equation is in standard form, directly read off the center \\((h, k)\\) and the radius \\(r\\) from the equation.\n\n5. **Calculating the Desired Sum:** After identifying \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(r\\), carefully add them together to find \\(a + b + r\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, you can substitute a point from the circle back into the original equation to verify that your transformation and calculations are correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
