{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** When evaluating functions at a specific value of \\( x \\), substitute the value directly into the function expressions. For example, for \\( f(4) \\), replace every \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) \\) with 4.\n\n2. **Simplification:** After substituting, simplify the expressions step by step. Ensure that you correctly handle the arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with terms that involve constants and variables.\n\n3. **Equation Solving:** Set up the equation as given in the problem (e.g., \\( 2f(4) = g(4) \\)) and solve for the variable \\( m \\). Isolate \\( m \\) by performing the necessary algebraic operations.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for any arithmetic errors, especially when multiplying or dividing by constants.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Once you find the value of \\( m \\), substitute it back into the original functions to verify that the equation \\( 2f(4) = g(4) \\) holds True. This step ensures the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
