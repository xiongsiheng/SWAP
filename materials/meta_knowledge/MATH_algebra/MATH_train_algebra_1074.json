{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Recognize and apply algebraic identities to simplify the expression. For example, the difference of squares identity, \\((x^2 - y^2) = (x - y)(x + y)\\), can be useful here.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values for variables, ensure that you substitute correctly and consistently across the entire expression.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to avoid arithmetic mistakes. This includes performing operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring each step is correct before moving on to the next. This helps in catching errors early.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After simplifying the expression, double-check your calculations, especially for multiplications and additions, as these are common areas for errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
