{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. For this problem, you can use the equations \\( x + y = 45 \\) and \\( x - y = 3 \\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are the two numbers.\n\n2. **Solving by Elimination or Substitution:** Choose a method to solve the system of equations. Elimination involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable, while substitution involves solving one equation for one variable and substituting it into the other equation.\n\n3. **Check Your Solution:** After finding the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), substitute them back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy both conditions.\n\n4. **Identify the Lesser Number:** Once you have the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), compare them to determine which is the lesser number.\n\n5. **Avoid Common Errors:** Be cautious of arithmetic mistakes, especially when adding, subtracting, or substituting values. Double-check your calculations to avoid errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
