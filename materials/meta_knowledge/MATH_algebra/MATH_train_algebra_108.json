{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving a quadratic equation by completing the square, consider the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form:** Ensure the quadratic equation is in the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants.\n\n2. **Divide by Leading Coefficient:** If \\(a\\) is not 1, divide all terms by \\(a\\) to make the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) equal to 1.\n\n3. **Move Constant Term:** Shift the constant term \\(c\\) to the other side of the equation.\n\n4. **Complete the Square:** Add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \\(x\\) on the left side of the equation. This step forms a perfect square trinomial.\n\n5. **Simplify:** Combine the constants on the right side and express the left side as a square of a binomial.\n\n6. **Solve for Variables:** Identify the constants \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) from the equation \\((x + r)^2 = s\\).\n\n7. **Check Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic operations, especially when squaring and adding terms, to avoid calculation errors.\n\n8. **Verification:** Substitute the derived values of \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) back into the equation to ensure correctness.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors and ensure accurate completion of the square for quadratic equations."}
