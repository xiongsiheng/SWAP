{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Squares and Differences:** Recognize that the difference between consecutive squares can be found using the formula \\((a+1)^2 - a^2 = 2a + 1\\). This formula helps in quickly calculating the difference between squares of consecutive numbers.\n\n2. **Applying the Formula:** For example, \\(31^2 - 30^2 = 2 \\cdot 30 + 1 = 61\\). This formula is useful for verifying calculations involving squares of nearby numbers.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** When subtracting a number to find a square, ensure that the calculation is consistent with the formula for squares of consecutive numbers. For instance, \\(30^2 - x = 29^2\\) should yield \\(x = 30^2 - 29^2 = (30 + 29)(30 - 29) = 59\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Results:** Always verify your calculations by re-computing or using a different method to ensure the correctness of your answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving squares and their differences."}
