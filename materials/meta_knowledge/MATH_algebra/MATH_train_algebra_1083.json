{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving equations involving absolute values, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. Therefore, $|x-7|$ and $|x+1|$ represent the distances of $x$ from 7 and -1, respectively.\n\n2. **Equating Distances:** When $|x-a| = |x-b|$, it means that $x$ is equidistant from $a$ and $b$. This can occur at two points: the midpoint of $a$ and $b$, and at the intersection points of the lines representing the distances.\n\n3. **Solving by Cases:** Break down the equation into cases based on where $x$ lies relative to the points 7 and -1. For example, consider the cases where $x \\geq 7$, $-1 \\leq x < 7$, and $x < -1$, and solve each case separately.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, verify each by substituting back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the condition.\n\n5. **Graphical Interpretation:** Optionally, visualize the problem on a number line or graph to help understand the geometric interpretation and confirm the number of solutions.\n\nThese strategies will help minimize errors and ensure accurate determination of the number of distinct solutions."}
