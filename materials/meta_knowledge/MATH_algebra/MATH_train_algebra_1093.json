{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex numbers raised to a power, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Use the Distributive Property:** When squaring a complex number, use the distributive property (i.e., the FOIL method for binomials) to ensure all terms are accounted for.\n\n2. **Square the Imaginary Unit:** Remember that \\(i^2 = -1\\). This is crucial when calculating terms involving \\(i\\).\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms:** After expanding, combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately to get the final form \\(a + bi\\).\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic, especially when dealing with negative signs and the multiplication of imaginary numbers, as these are common sources of error.\n\n5. **Simplify Fully:** Ensure that your final answer is in the simplest form of \\(a + bi\\), with no further simplifications possible.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying complex numbers raised to a power."}
