{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying and combining algebraic expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms correctly. Terms with the same variable raised to the same power (e.g., \\(d\\), \\(d^2\\)) should be grouped together.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Ensure you apply the distributive property correctly if needed. This involves distributing multiplication over addition or subtraction.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Operations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, especially when dealing with coefficients and constants.\n\n4. **Coefficient Identification:** Accurately identify and extract the coefficients of each term (i.e., \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in the form \\(ad + b + cd^2\\)).\n\n5. **Final Sum Calculation:** After identifying \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), correctly sum them to find \\(a + b + c\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying and combining algebraic expressions."}
