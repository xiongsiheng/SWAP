{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Equations:** Start by simplifying the given equation. Ensure that you expand and combine like terms correctly to form a standard quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Identifying Coefficients:** Once you have a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), correctly identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). This is crucial for using the quadratic formula or factoring.\n\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring is not straightforward, use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Ensure you correctly compute the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) and handle the square root accurately.\n\n4. **Sum and Product of Roots:** Recall that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(p + q = -\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the roots \\(pq = \frac{c}{a}\\). These relationships can simplify calculations.\n\n5. **Substitution and Simplification:** When calculating \\((p + 3)(q + 3)\\), use the values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) or their sum and product to simplify the expression. Ensure you distribute and combine terms correctly.\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding the final answer, consider verifying it by substituting the roots back into the original expression to ensure it holds True. This step can catch errors in algebraic manipulation or calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
