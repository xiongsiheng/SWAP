{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions like \\((2x + 5)^2\\) for a given value of \\(x\\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the value of \\(x\\) correctly into the expression. In this case, replace \\(x\\) with 3.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression. This means performing the multiplication inside the parentheses before squaring the result.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially multiplication and squaring, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the calculations, double-check your work to ensure that each step was executed correctly.\n\n5. **Use of Formula:** If applicable, use known algebraic identities or formulas to simplify the expression. For example, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) can be used here.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the value of the expression for the given \\(x\\)."}
