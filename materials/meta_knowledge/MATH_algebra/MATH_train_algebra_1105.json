{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Forms:** Recognize that \\(16^{16}\\) can be rewritten as \\(2^{4 \\cdot 16}\\) since \\(16 = 2^4\\). This simplifies the expression to \\(2^{64}\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** When you have multiple terms that are identical, such as \\(16^{16}\\) appearing four times, combine them by multiplication. This simplifies the left side of the equation.\n\n3. **Equating Exponents:** When two expressions are equal and their bases are the same (in this case, base 2), their exponents must be equal. This allows you to set the exponents from both sides of the equation equal to each other.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you accurately calculate the exponents, especially when dealing with large numbers or complex expressions.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
