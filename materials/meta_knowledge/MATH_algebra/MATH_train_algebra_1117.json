{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the 21st term of an arithmetic sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequence:** An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is called the common difference (d).\n\n2. **Formula for the nth Term:** The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Identifying the Common Difference:** Calculate the common difference by subtracting the first term from the second term (or any two consecutive terms).\n\n4. **Using the Formula Correctly:** Substitute the values of \\(a_1\\), \\(d\\), and \\(n\\) correctly into the formula to find the desired term.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when multiplying and adding, to avoid computational errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by manually calculating a few terms of the sequence to ensure consistency with the formula.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the 21st term in an arithmetic sequence."}
