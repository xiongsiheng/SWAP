{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Use the algebraic identity \\(x^2 + y^2 = (x - y)^2 + 2xy\\) to simplify the calculation. This identity is derived from the expansion of \\((x - y)^2\\) and the inclusion of the product term \\(2xy\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Substitute the given values \\(x - y = 15\\) and \\(xy = 4\\) into the identity to directly compute \\(x^2 + y^2\\).\n\n3. **Check Calculations:** Ensure that you correctly square the difference \\(x - y\\) and multiply \\(2xy\\) without making arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) independently using the quadratic formula and then calculating \\(x^2 + y^2\\) directly, although this method is more complex and prone to calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
