{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance between the center of a circle and a given point, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Circle:** Recognize that the equation of a circle in standard form is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. For the given equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = -4x + 6y - 12\\), you need to rewrite it in standard form by completing the square.\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** When completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms, ensure you correctly identify the coefficients and form the perfect square trinomials. This step is crucial for finding the correct center of the circle.\n\n3. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\) to calculate the distance between the center of the circle \\((h, k)\\) and the point \\((1, 7)\\). Be meticulous with your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic operations, especially when squaring numbers and taking square roots, as these steps are prone to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your calculations by using a different method or calculator to ensure the accuracy of your results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
