{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). The nth term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Finding the Common Ratio:** Use the given terms to find the common ratio. For example, if the first term \\(a_1\\) and the fourth term \\(a_4\\) are given, you can set up the equation \\(a_4 = a_1 \\cdot r^3\\) and solve for \\(r\\).\n\n3. **Calculating Intermediate Terms:** Once you have the common ratio, calculate the intermediate terms by multiplying the preceding term by the common ratio. For instance, to find the third term \\(a_3\\), you would use \\(a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^2\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you perform all multiplications correctly, as errors in calculating the common ratio or intermediate terms can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your calculations by checking that the terms fit the geometric sequence pattern, especially by ensuring that the given fourth term matches the product of the first term and the cube of the common ratio.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
