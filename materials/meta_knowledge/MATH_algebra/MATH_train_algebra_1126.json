{"Knowledge": "To determine the vertical asymptote of a rational function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Denominator Analysis:** A vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator of the function equals zero, as the function approaches infinity at these points.\n\n2. **Factorization:** If possible, factor both the numerator and the denominator to identify any common factors that could be canceled, which would eliminate potential asymptotes.\n\n3. **Solving for Zero:** Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\). This will give you the \\( x \\)-values where the vertical asymptote(s) occur.\n\n4. **Domain Exclusion:** Remember that the domain of the function excludes the \\( x \\)-values that make the denominator zero, as these points are not defined in the function.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your findings by graphing the function to visually confirm the presence and location of the vertical asymptote.\n\nThese steps will help you accurately identify the vertical asymptote in rational functions."}
