{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). The nth term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as \\(a \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Finding the Common Ratio:** Use the given terms to find the common ratio. For example, if the first term \\(a\\) and the fifth term are given, you can set up the equation \\(a \\cdot r^4 = 162\\) to solve for \\(r\\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Sixth Term:** Once you have the common ratio, the sixth term can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, which is \\(a \\cdot r^5\\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that you perform all calculations accurately, especially when dealing with exponents and multiplications, as these steps are critical to finding the correct term in the sequence.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Results:** After calculating the sixth term, double-check your work by ensuring that the sequence adheres to the properties of a geometric sequence and that the terms align with the given information.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving geometric sequences."}
