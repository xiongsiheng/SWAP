{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Circle Properties:** Recall that the center of a circle is equidistant from all points on the circle. This property is crucial for setting up the correct equations.\n\n2. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the distance between two points, which is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). This formula helps in finding the radius of the circle.\n\n3. **Equation of a Circle:** Remember that the standard form of a circle's equation is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. Since the center is on the x-axis, \\(k = 0\\).\n\n4. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given points to set up equations based on the distance from the center to each point being equal to the radius.\n\n5. **Solving for Variables:** Carefully solve the resulting equations to find the coordinates of the center and the radius. Pay attention to algebraic manipulations to avoid calculation errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you have calculated the radius, verify by checking that both given points satisfy the circle's equation with the found center and radius.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
