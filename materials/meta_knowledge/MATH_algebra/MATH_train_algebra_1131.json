{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Midpoints:** The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\). This formula is crucial for finding the vertices of the new polygons formed by the midpoints of the sides.\n\n2. **Sum of Coordinates:** The sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the vertices of a polygon remains invariant under the transformation of forming new polygons by taking midpoints of sides. This is because the operation of finding midpoints does not change the total sum of the coordinates.\n\n3. **Geometric Transformations:** Recognize that the process of forming new polygons by taking midpoints of sides is a form of affine transformation. Affine transformations preserve the sum of the coordinates, which simplifies the problem.\n\n4. **Verification:** Always verify your final answer by ensuring it aligns with the properties of the geometric transformations and the given conditions. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
