{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Variation:** Recall that if \\(a^2\\) varies inversely with \\(b^3\\), then \\(a^2 \\cdot b^3 = k\\) for some constant \\(k\\). This relationship is crucial for setting up and solving the problem.\n\n2. **Finding the Constant \\(k\\):** Use the given values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to determine the constant \\(k\\). For example, if \\(a = 7\\) when \\(b = 3\\), then \\(k = 7^2 \\cdot 3^3\\).\n\n3. **Using the Constant \\(k\\):** Once \\(k\\) is determined, use it to find the new value of \\(a^2\\) when \\(b\\) changes. Set up the equation \\(a^2 \\cdot b^3 = k\\) with the new value of \\(b\\) and solve for \\(a^2\\).\n\n4. **Careful Calculations:** Ensure that you perform all calculations accurately, especially when squaring and cubing numbers, and when multiplying and dividing.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by substituting the new values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) back into the inverse variation relationship to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
