{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this system of linear equations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you have a system of four linear equations with four variables. This system can be solved using substitution or elimination methods.\n\n2. **Adding Equations:** Consider adding all the equations together to simplify the system. This can help in finding the sum of the variables more directly.\n\n3. **Checking Consistency:** Ensure that the equations are consistent with each other. Inconsistent equations would indicate a mistake in the problem setup or in the algebraic manipulations.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding or subtracting coefficients, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Substitution and Elimination:** When using substitution or elimination, be meticulous about which variable you choose to eliminate or substitute, and ensure that you correctly adjust the coefficients and signs.\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding the values of the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy all conditions. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
