{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving inequalities like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** Start by solving the corresponding quadratic equation (in this case, \\(x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0\\)) to find the critical points. These points divide the number line into intervals.\n\n2. **Testing Intervals:** Test a point from each interval determined by the critical points to determine where the inequality holds True. This helps in identifying the correct intervals where the inequality is satisfied.\n\n3. **Sign Analysis:** Use a sign chart or graph to analyze where the quadratic expression is positive or negative. This can help in determining the correct intervals without having to test each interval individually.\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** Express the solution in interval notation correctly, ensuring that you include the correct endpoints (open or closed) based on whether the inequality is strict (<) or includes equality (<=).\n\n5. **Double-Check Solutions:** Substitute values from your solution intervals back into the original inequality to confirm that they satisfy the inequality. This step helps in catching any errors in interval selection or calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic inequalities and expressing the solutions in interval notation."}
