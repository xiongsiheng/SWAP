{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Recognize that the problem involves finding the maximum value of a linear expression (x + y) under the constraints of a quadratic equation (x^2 + y^2 = 90) and a product condition (xy = 27). This is typically a problem involving algebraic manipulation and optimization.\n\n2. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Utilize algebraic identities such as (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy to simplify expressions and find relationships between variables.\n\n3. **Maximizing Expressions:** Understand that to maximize x + y, you need to consider the relationship between the quadratic terms and the product term. This often involves completing the square or using other algebraic techniques to express x + y in a form that can be maximized.\n\n4. **Checking Constraints:** Ensure that any solution you derive satisfies both the original constraints (x^2 + y^2 = 90 and xy = 27). This step is crucial to verify that the solution is valid.\n\n5. **Numerical Accuracy:** Pay close attention to the accuracy of your calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and other non-linear operations, as these can introduce errors if not handled carefully.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
