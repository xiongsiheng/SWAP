{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Using the Factor Theorem:** Recognize that if a number is a solution to a quadratic equation, it can be used to form factors of the polynomial. For example, if \\(-7\\) is a solution, then \\((x + 7)\\) is a factor of the polynomial.\n\n2. **Forming the Quadratic Equation from Roots:** If you know one root of a quadratic equation, you can use it along with the given quadratic form to find the other root or the coefficient. For instance, if \\(-7\\) is a root, the quadratic can be written as \\((x + 7)(x - r) = 0\\), where \\(r\\) is the other root.\n\n3. **Solving for Coefficients:** Once you have the factors, expand them to match the given quadratic form \\(x^2 + bx - 28 = 0\\) and solve for \\(b\\) by comparing coefficients.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations when expanding the factors and solving for \\(b\\), as arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect values for \\(b\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the value of \\(b\\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds True with the given root, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
