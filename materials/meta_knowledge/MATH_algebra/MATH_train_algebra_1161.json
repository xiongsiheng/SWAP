{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Proportions:** Ensure you correctly understand and apply the concept of proportions. The total amount of flour used remains constant, so the relationship between the number of pie crusts and the amount of flour per crust is inversely proportional.\n\n2. **Fraction Operations:** Be proficient in operations involving fractions, such as multiplication and division. For example, multiplying \\(\frac{1}{6}\\) cup by 30 to find the total amount of flour used initially.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** After calculating the amount of flour per new crust, simplify the fraction to its simplest form. This involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations step by step to ensure that each operation is performed correctly. This includes checking the total flour used and then dividing it by the new number of crusts.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure that all calculations are consistent in terms of units (cups of flour). This helps avoid errors in unit conversion or misinterpretation of quantities.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
