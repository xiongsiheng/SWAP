{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of a segment, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint of a segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\).\n\n2. **Coordinate Addition:** When adding coordinates, ensure you add the corresponding x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately.\n\n3. **Division by Two:** After adding the coordinates, divide each sum by 2 to find the midpoint coordinates.\n\n4. **Sum of Midpoint Coordinates:** To find the sum of the midpoint coordinates, simply add the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the midpoint.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations for adding and dividing coordinates to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
