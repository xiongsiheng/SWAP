{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Infinite Continued Fractions:** Recognize that expressions like \\( x = 1 + \frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1 + \frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1 + \\cdots}} \\) represent infinite continued fractions. These can often be simplified by setting up an equation where \\( x \\) equals the entire expression, then solving for \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\( x \\):** When setting up the equation \\( x = 1 + \frac{\\sqrt{2}}{x} \\), solve it carefully. This typically involves isolating \\( x \\) and solving a quadratic equation. Ensure you handle the square root and division correctly.\n\n3. **Simplifying Complex Fractions:** When dealing with nested fractions, simplify from the innermost part outward. This helps avoid errors in simplification and calculation.\n\n4. **Handling Quadratic Equations:** When solving quadratic equations, use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding \\( x \\), substitute it back into the original expression to verify correctness. This step is crucial to ensure that the solution is not only mathematically correct but also satisfies the original problem statement.\n\n6. **Calculating the Final Expression:** When finding \\( \frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)} \\), simplify the denominator carefully. Ensure that the final form \\( \frac{A + \\sqrt{B}}{C} \\) is correctly identified, and calculate \\( |A| + |B| + |C| \\) accurately.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
