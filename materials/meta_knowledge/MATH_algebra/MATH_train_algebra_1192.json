{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Completing the Square:** Completing the square involves transforming a quadratic expression from the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) to \\(a(x + h)^2 + k\\). Ensure you correctly identify the coefficients and apply the process accurately.\n\n2. **Matching Forms:** When given a quadratic in completed square form, match it to the standard form \\(a(x + h)^2 + k\\) to find the values of \\(h\\) and \\(k\\). This helps in identifying the original coefficients.\n\n3. **Handling Fractions:** Be precise when dealing with fractions, especially in operations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Missteps with fractions can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Sign Consistency:** Pay attention to the signs of coefficients, particularly when dealing with negative numbers. Ensure that the sign of \\(b\\) is consistent with the given conditions.\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining the value of \\(b\\), substitute it back into the original quadratic to verify that the transformation to the completed square form is correct. This step helps catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
