{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inequalities:** Ensure you correctly interpret the inequality. For example, \\(200 < n^2 < 900\\) means \\(n^2\\) must be greater than 200 and less than 900.\n\n2. **Finding Range of \\(n\\):** Determine the range of \\(n\\) by finding the square roots of the boundary values. For instance, \\(\\sqrt{200}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{900}\\) will give you the approximate lower and upper bounds for \\(n\\).\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(n\\) must be a positive integer, round down the lower bound and round up the upper bound to the nearest integers.\n\n4. **Counting Integers:** Count the integers between these rounded bounds, inclusive. This will give you the number of possible values for \\(n\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify by listing out the integers within the range to ensure no values are missed.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
