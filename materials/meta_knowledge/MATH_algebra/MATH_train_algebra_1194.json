{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand that each time you eat half of the remaining pizza, the amount eaten is cumulative.\n\n2. **Geometric Series:** Recognize that the amount of pizza eaten forms a geometric series where each term is half of the previous term.\n\n3. **Sum of Geometric Series:** Use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series \\(S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio. In this case, \\(a = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Finite Series Calculation:** Since the series is finite (only 5 terms), calculate the sum of the first 5 terms using the formula for a finite geometric series \\(S_n = a \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}\\).\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and exponents, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your result by manually adding the fractions eaten in each trip to ensure the sum matches your calculated result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
