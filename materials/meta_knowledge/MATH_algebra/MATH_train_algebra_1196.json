{"Knowledge": "To determine when a rational expression is not defined, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Denominator:** The expression is undefined where the denominator is zero. In this case, the denominator is \\(x^2 - 20x + 100\\).\n\n2. **Solve for Zero in the Denominator:** Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\(x\\). This involves solving the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Factoring or Using the Quadratic Formula:** To solve the quadratic equation, you can try factoring it. If factoring is not straightforward, use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients from the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Check for Real Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions you find are real numbers, as complex or imaginary solutions do not affect the real-valued domain of the expression.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the values of \\(x\\) that make the denominator zero, verify that these values indeed make the expression undefined by substituting them back into the original expression.\n\nThese steps will help you accurately determine the values of \\(x\\) for which the expression is not defined."}
