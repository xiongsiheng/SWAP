{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Proportionality:** Directly proportional means that as one quantity increases, the other quantity increases at the same rate. This can be expressed mathematically as \\( y = kx \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Finding the Constant of Proportionality:** Use the given information to find the constant \\( k \\). In this case, \\( k \\) is the fare per mile, which can be calculated by dividing the total fare by the distance traveled.\n\n3. **Applying the Constant:** Once \\( k \\) is determined, use it to calculate the fare for the new distance by multiplying the new distance by \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Checking Units:** Ensure that all units are consistent and correct. For example, if distances are in miles, the fare should be in dollars per mile.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the new fare is correctly calculated based on the proportional relationship.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
