{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) correctly into the expression. Double-check that you have not mixed up the values or made transcription errors.\n\n2. **Exponent Rules:** Apply exponent rules correctly. Remember that \\( (a \\cdot b)^n = a^n \\cdot b^n \\) and \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n} \\). This will help in simplifying the expression efficiently.\n\n3. **Fraction Multiplication:** When multiplying fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together separately. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) strictly, especially when dealing with exponents and multiplications.\n\n5. **Simplification:** Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each step is logically correct and leads to the final answer. Avoid skipping steps to maintain clarity and accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
