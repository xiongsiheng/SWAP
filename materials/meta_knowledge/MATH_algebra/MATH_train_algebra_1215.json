{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\) returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). This means \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\) is an integer and \\(x\\) is a real number such that \\(\\lceil x \\rceil - 1 < x \\leq \\lceil x \\rceil\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Since \\(\\lceil x \\rceil \\cdot x = 135\\), you need to find an integer \\(n = \\lceil x \\rceil\\) and a corresponding \\(x\\) such that \\(n \\cdot x = 135\\). This implies \\(x = \\frac{135}{n}\\).\n\n3. **Checking Range:** For \\(x\\) to satisfy the ceiling condition, \\(\\frac{135}{n}\\) must lie in the interval \\([n-1, n)\\). This helps in narrowing down the possible values of \\(n\\).\n\n4. **Iterative Approach:** Test integer values for \\(n\\) starting from the smallest possible integer greater than \\(\\sqrt{135}\\) (since \\(n \\cdot x = 135\\) and both \\(n\\) and \\(x\\) are positive).\n\n5. **Precision in Calculations:** When calculating \\(x = \\frac{135}{n}\\), ensure you use precise decimal calculations to accurately determine if \\(x\\) lies within the required interval.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you find a candidate \\(x\\), verify that \\(\\lceil x \\rceil \\cdot x = 135\\) to ensure the solution is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
