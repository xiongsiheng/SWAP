{"Knowledge": "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = x^k \\) on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\), consider the following points:\n\n1. **Monotonicity:** Since \\( k > 0 \\), the function \\( f(x) = x^k \\) is monotonically increasing on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\). This means that as \\( x \\) increases, \\( f(x) \\) also increases.\n\n2. **Endpoints:** Evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval. At \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) = 1^k = 1 \\). As \\( x \\) approaches \\(\\infty\\), \\( f(x) \\) also approaches \\(\\infty\\).\n\n3. **Range Determination:** Since \\( f(x) \\) is increasing and starts at 1 and goes to \\(\\infty\\), the range of \\( f(x) \\) on \\([1, \\infty)\\) is \\([1, \\infty)\\).\n\n4. **Graphical Understanding:** Visualizing the graph of \\( f(x) = x^k \\) for \\( k > 0 \\) can help confirm that the function increases from 1 to \\(\\infty\\) as \\( x \\) increases from 1 to \\(\\infty\\).\n\nThese points help ensure that you correctly determine the range of the function on the given interval."}
