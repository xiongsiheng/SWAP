{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the solutions. For the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly.\n\n2. **Discriminant:** Calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to ensure it is non-negative, as a negative discriminant indicates no real solutions.\n\n3. **Simplifying Roots:** When simplifying the square root in the quadratic formula, ensure you correctly simplify \\(\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\\) and perform the arithmetic accurately.\n\n4. **Identifying Solutions:** Recognize that the quadratic formula gives two solutions, one using the plus sign and one using the minus sign. Identify which solution is positive and express it in the required form.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to verify their correctness, especially when dealing with expressions involving square roots.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations and finding the required form of the solution."}
