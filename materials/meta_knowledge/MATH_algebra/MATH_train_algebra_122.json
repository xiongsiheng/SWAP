{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing nested function values, consider the following:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** Clearly understand the piecewise definition of the function. Identify which part of the function applies based on the input value.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply the function transformations step by step, starting from the innermost function and moving outward. Ensure each step correctly applies the appropriate part of the piecewise function.\n\n3. **Sign of Inputs:** Pay attention to whether the input to the function is positive or negative, as this determines which part of the piecewise function to use.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with negative numbers and squaring operations.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify intermediate steps by substituting back the computed values to ensure they match the function definition.\n\nThese points will help minimize mistakes when dealing with nested function evaluations."}
