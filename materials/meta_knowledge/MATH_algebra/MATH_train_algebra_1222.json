{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Always follow the correct order of operations, which is Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly when expanding expressions, especially when dealing with nested parentheses.\n\n3. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify each part of the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n4. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values for variables, ensure that you substitute correctly and consistently across the entire expression.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After simplifying the expression, double-check your calculations to ensure that no arithmetic errors were made.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
