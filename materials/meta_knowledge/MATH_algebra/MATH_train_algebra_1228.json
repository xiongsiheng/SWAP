{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving quadratic equations like this one, consider the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients from the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the given equation.\n\n2. **Discriminant:** Calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to determine the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex). This helps verify if you should expect two distinct real solutions.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and divisions. Small errors in these calculations can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying expressions, particularly within the quadratic formula.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the solutions, substitute them back into the original equation to confirm they are correct. This step is crucial for catching any computational errors.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately find the larger of the two distinct solutions to the quadratic equation."}
