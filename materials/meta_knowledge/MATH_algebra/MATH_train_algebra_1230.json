{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportions:** Recognize that the number of men and the number of days required to complete the same task are inversely proportional. As the number of men increases, the number of days decreases, and vice versa.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Proportion:** Use the formula for inverse proportion: \\( \text{Number of men}_1 \times \text{Number of days}_1 = \text{Number of men}_2 \times \text{Number of days}_2 \\). This helps in setting up the correct relationship between the variables.\n\n3. **Calculating Correctly:** Ensure that you perform the arithmetic calculations accurately. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid simple arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with decimals.\n\n4. **Rounding Properly:** When expressing the answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth, round the final result correctly. Remember that rounding should be done only at the end of the calculation to maintain accuracy.\n\n5. **Double-Checking the Answer:** Verify your final answer by cross-checking it with the initial conditions to ensure that the logic and calculations are correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inverse proportions."}
