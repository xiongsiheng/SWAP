{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages:** Convert percentages to decimal form for easier calculations. For example, 20% becomes 0.20 and 30% becomes 0.30.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use variables to represent the number of three-point and two-point shots attempted. Set up equations based on the total number of shots and the percentages of successful shots.\n\n3. **Calculating Points:** Multiply the number of successful shots by their respective point values (3 points for three-point shots and 2 points for two-point shots) to find the total points scored.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when multiplying numbers by percentages and summing the results.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** Verify that the total number of shots attempted matches the sum of the three-point and two-point shots you calculated. This step helps ensure that your breakdown of shots is accurate.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
