{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** When dealing with rational expressions, factorize the numerator and denominator if possible to simplify the expression. For example, recognize that \\( t^2 - t - 56 \\) can be factored into \\( (t - 8)(t + 7) \\).\n\n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** When solving equations involving fractions, cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators. This can help in transforming the equation into a simpler form.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** After simplifying, you may end up with a quadratic equation. Use the quadratic formula \\( t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) or factorize to find the roots.\n\n4. **Domain Restrictions:** Be aware of the domain restrictions imposed by the denominators. For instance, \\( t \neq 8 \\) and \\( t \neq -5 \\) in this problem, as these values would make the denominators zero.\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation without violating any domain restrictions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
