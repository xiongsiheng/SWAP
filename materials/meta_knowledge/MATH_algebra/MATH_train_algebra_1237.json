{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Calculate Hourly Rate:** First, determine Amy's hourly wage by dividing the total amount earned by the total hours worked during the summer.\n\n2. **Use Proportional Reasoning:** Recognize that the relationship between hours worked and pay earned is proportional. If Amy needs to earn the same amount over a different number of weeks, the hourly rate remains constant.\n\n3. **Set Up an Equation:** Use the hourly rate to set up an equation where the unknown is the number of hours Amy needs to work per week during the school year.\n\n4. **Solve for the Unknown:** Isolate the variable representing the number of hours per week by performing the necessary arithmetic operations.\n\n5. **Check Your Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic to ensure accuracy, especially when dividing and multiplying to find the hourly rate and then solving for the number of hours per week.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving this type of problem."}
