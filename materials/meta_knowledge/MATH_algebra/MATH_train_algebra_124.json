{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Quadratics:** Remember the standard form of a quadratic equation is \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\). To factor it into the form \\((x - a)(x - b)\\), find two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a + b = -b\\) (the coefficient of \\(x\\)) and \\(ab = c\\) (the constant term).\n\n2. **Checking Factors:** Ensure that the factors you find correctly multiply back to the original quadratic expression. This step helps verify the correctness of your factoring.\n\n3. **Nonnegative Integers:** Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are specified to be nonnegative integers, focus on pairs of integers that meet this criterion and satisfy the sum and product conditions.\n\n4. **Order of Factors:** Given \\(a > b\\), make sure to assign the larger value to \\(a\\) and the smaller value to \\(b\\) after factoring.\n\n5. **Substitution and Calculation:** After identifying \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), substitute these values into the expression \\(3b - a\\) and perform the arithmetic carefully to avoid calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
