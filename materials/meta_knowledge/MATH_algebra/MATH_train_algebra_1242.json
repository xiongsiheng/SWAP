{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating the Equation:** Represent the three consecutive integers as \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\). The sum of their squares can be expressed as \\( (n-1)^2 + n^2 + (n+1)^2 \\).\n\n2. **Simplifying the Equation:** Simplify the sum of squares expression to a quadratic equation in terms of \\( n \\). This involves expanding and combining like terms carefully.\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Use the quadratic formula \\( n = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the value of \\( n \\). Ensure that the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) is non-negative and that the solution is a positive integer.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum of Cubes:** Once you have the value of \\( n \\), calculate the cubes of \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\), and then sum them. Ensure accurate arithmetic throughout this process.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check all calculations, especially the arithmetic operations involved in squaring and cubing numbers, and ensure the final sum matches the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
