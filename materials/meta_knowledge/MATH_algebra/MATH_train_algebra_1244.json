{"Knowledge": "To determine when a rational expression is undefined, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Denominator:** The expression is undefined where the denominator is zero. In this case, the denominator is \\(a^2 - 4\\).\n\n2. **Solve for Zero:** Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\(a\\). This involves solving the equation \\(a^2 - 4 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Factorization:** Factor the quadratic expression if possible. Here, \\(a^2 - 4\\) can be factored as \\((a - 2)(a + 2)\\).\n\n4. **Find the Values:** Determine the values of \\(a\\) that make each factor zero. This gives \\(a = 2\\) and \\(a = -2\\).\n\n5. **List in Order:** Ensure you list the values in increasing order as requested.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the values of \\(a\\) that make the expression undefined."}
