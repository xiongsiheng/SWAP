{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) correctly into the expression. Misplacing or miscalculating the substitution can lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Fraction Operations:** Be proficient in operations involving fractions, such as multiplication and division. Remember to multiply numerators with numerators and denominators with denominators, and simplify fractions whenever possible.\n\n3. **Simplification Techniques:** Use proper simplification techniques for complex fractions. This includes finding common denominators, canceling common factors, and reducing fractions to their simplest form.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression. This ensures that the operations are performed in the correct sequence, avoiding common errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After solving, double-check each step of your calculation to catch any arithmetic mistakes. This includes verifying the substitution, the operations performed, and the final simplified result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
