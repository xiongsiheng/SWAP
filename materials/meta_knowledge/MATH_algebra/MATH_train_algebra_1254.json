{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the product of the solutions of a quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) for an equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Vieta's Formulas:** Use Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the solutions \\(x_1 + x_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the solutions \\(x_1 \\cdot x_2 = \\frac{c}{a}\\).\n\n3. **Standard Form:** Ensure the equation is in standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) before applying Vieta's formulas.\n\n4. **Coefficient Signs:** Pay attention to the signs of the coefficients when using Vieta's formulas, as incorrect signs can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the application of Vieta's formulas by ensuring the product and sum of the solutions match the given equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the product of the solutions of a quadratic equation."}
