{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cube Roots and Negative Values:** Remember that the cube root function can handle negative values. For example, \\(\\sqrt[3]{-a} = -\\sqrt[3]{a}\\).\n\n2. **Isolating Variables:** When solving for a variable under a cube root, isolate the cube root on one side of the equation before cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root.\n\n3. **Cubing Both Sides:** When you cube both sides of an equation, ensure that you correctly apply the cube operation. For example, \\((a)^3 = a^3\\) and \\((-a)^3 = -a^3\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and negative numbers, as these can lead to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
