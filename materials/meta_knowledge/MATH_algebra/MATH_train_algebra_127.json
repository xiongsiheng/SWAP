{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given equation is a quadratic equation representing the height of a projectile over time. The general form is \\(y = at^2 + bt + c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find the time \\(t\\) when the projectile reaches a specific height \\(y\\), set the equation equal to that height (in this case, 36 feet) and solve for \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratics:** Use the quadratic formula \\(t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to solve for \\(t\\). Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the equation.\n\n4. **Interpreting Roots:** When you obtain two solutions from the quadratic formula, choose the one that makes physical sense for the problem (e.g., the first positive time when the projectile reaches the specified height).\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Perform all calculations carefully, especially when dealing with square roots and divisions. Round your final answer to the nearest tenth as specified.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, substitute your calculated time \\(t\\) back into the original equation to verify that it yields the correct height. This step can help catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
