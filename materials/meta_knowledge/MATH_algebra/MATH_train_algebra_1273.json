{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** When converting a quadratic expression into the form \\((x+b)^2+c\\), you need to complete the square. This involves rearranging the quadratic expression by adding and subtracting the same value inside the equation.\n\n2. **Identifying Constants:** After completing the square, identify the constants \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) correctly. \\(b\\) is the coefficient of \\(x\\) divided by 2, and \\(c\\) is the constant term that results after completing the square.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform arithmetic operations accurately, especially when squaring and adding/subtracting terms. Small arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect values for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), verify your solution by expanding \\((x+b)^2+c\\) to check if it matches the original quadratic expression. This step helps confirm the correctness of your transformation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
