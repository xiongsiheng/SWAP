{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Area Calculation:** Remember that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the side length (Area = side length\u00b2). Ensure you correctly square the given side lengths.\n\n2. **Ratio Formation:** When forming the ratio of the areas, use the areas directly calculated from the side lengths. The ratio of the areas is simply the ratio of their side lengths squared.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** After calculating the ratio, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms. This involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Recheck your calculations for squaring the side lengths and simplifying the fraction to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the ratio by calculating the actual areas and then forming the ratio to see if it matches your simplified fraction.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
