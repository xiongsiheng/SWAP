{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the compound interest formula to calculate the future value of the investment: \\(A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(n\\) years, including interest; \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money); \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal); \\(n\\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year; and \\(t\\) is the number of years the money is invested.\n\n2. **Correct Application of the Formula:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the values into the formula. For this problem, since the interest is compounded yearly, \\(n = 1\\), simplifying the formula to \\(A = P(1 + r)^t\\).\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Perform all calculations carefully, especially when dealing with exponents and decimal places. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Rounding:** Round your final answer to the nearest hundredth of a dollar as specified in the problem. Be sure to round correctly, following standard rounding rules.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your calculations by performing them again or using a different method to ensure the accuracy of your answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
