{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when performing mental calculations like \\(99 \times 99\\), consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Use Known Multiplication Facts:** Leverage known multiplication facts (like squares of numbers close to 100) to simplify the calculation. For example, \\(100 \times 100 = 10000\\).\n\n2. **Apply Algebraic Identities:** Use algebraic identities such as \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) to break down the problem into simpler parts. Here, \\(99 = 100 - 1\\), so \\(99 \times 99 = (100 - 1)^2\\).\n\n3. **Break Down the Calculation:** Break down the multiplication into manageable parts. For instance, calculate \\(100 \times 99\\) and then adjust for the extra \\(1 \times 99\\).\n\n4. **Check Calculations by Estimation:** Quickly estimate the result by rounding numbers and then multiplying. For \\(99 \times 99\\), an estimate using \\(100 \times 100\\) can provide a rough check.\n\n5. **Double-Check the Final Answer:** After calculating mentally, verify the result using a simple check, such as adding \\(99\\) to itself \\(99\\) times or using a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese strategies can help minimize errors and improve accuracy in mental math calculations."}
