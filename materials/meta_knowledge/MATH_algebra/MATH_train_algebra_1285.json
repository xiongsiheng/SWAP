{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving absolute values and floor functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. For any real number \\( x \\), \\( |x| \\) is always non-negative.\n\n2. **Floor Function Basics:** The floor function, denoted \\( \\lfloor x \rfloor \\), returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\). This means it rounds down to the nearest whole number.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Apply the absolute value first, then the floor function. This ensures that you correctly handle the non-negative result from the absolute value before applying the floor function.\n\n4. **Decimal Handling:** When dealing with decimals in the context of the floor function, remember that \\( \\lfloor x \rfloor \\) will always be the integer part of \\( x \\), effectively discarding any fractional part.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the final result by ensuring it matches the expected integer value after applying both the absolute value and the floor function.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
