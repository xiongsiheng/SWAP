{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( f(g(x)) \\) means you first apply the function \\( g \\) to \\( x \\), and then apply the function \\( f \\) to the result of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you perform the operations in the correct sequence: first evaluate \\( g(x) \\) at the given value, then use that result to evaluate \\( f \\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when squaring numbers or performing simple additions, as these can lead to common mistakes.\n\n4. **Substitution:** When substituting values into functions, make sure you substitute correctly and evaluate each step thoroughly.\n\n5. **Double-Check Results:** After calculating, double-check your steps and the final result to ensure there are no arithmetic errors or misapplications of the functions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
