{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Average Speed:** Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. In this case, the total distance is twice the distance between points A and B.\n\n2. **Time Calculation:** Time is calculated by dividing distance by speed. Ensure you calculate the time for each segment of the trip accurately.\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the formula for average speed to set up an equation involving the unknown speed on the return trip. This equation will help you solve for the unknown.\n\n4. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure all units are consistent, especially when dealing with distance, speed, and time. Use miles for distance and hours for time.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with fractions or decimals, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Logical Reasoning:** Ensure that the solution makes logical sense. For example, the return speed should be less than the average speed if the car took longer to return.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
