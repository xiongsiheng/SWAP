{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the total distance traveled in a problem like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Paths:** Recognize that the path described involves three segments: from $(-4,5)$ to $(0,0)$, from $(0,0)$ to $(5,-4)$, and the sum of these distances is the total distance traveled.\n\n2. **Using the Distance Formula:** Apply the distance formula correctly to each segment. The distance formula between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n3. **Calculating Each Segment:** Calculate the distance for each segment separately to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy. For example, the distance from $(-4,5)$ to $(0,0)$ is \\(\\sqrt{(0 - (-4))^2 + (0 - 5)^2}\\), and similarly for the other segment.\n\n4. **Adding Distances:** After calculating each segment's distance, add these distances together to get the total distance. Ensure that you add the correct values and avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify each step of your calculations, especially the application of the distance formula and the addition of distances, to ensure that no mistakes have been made.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors and ensure accurate calculation of the total distance traveled."}
