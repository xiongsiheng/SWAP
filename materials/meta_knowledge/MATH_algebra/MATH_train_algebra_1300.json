{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding Binomials:** Use the distributive property or the binomial theorem to expand expressions like \\((x+1)^2\\) and \\((3-x)^2\\). Remember that \\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) and \\((a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms carefully. This involves adding or subtracting terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** Look for common factors or patterns that can simplify the expression further. For example, recognize that \\(2(x+1)(3-x)\\) can be expanded and then simplified.\n\n4. **Double-Check Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying and adding terms, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute a known value of \\(x\\) into the original expression and the simplified expression to ensure they yield the same result. This step will catch most errors introduced during simplification.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
