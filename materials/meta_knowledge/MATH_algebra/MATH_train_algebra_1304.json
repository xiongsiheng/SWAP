{"Knowledge": "To solve this problem, consider the following key points:\n\n1. **Graph Interpretation:** Understand how to interpret the graph of a function. Identify the key features such as the x-intercepts, y-intercepts, maxima, minima, and points of inflection.\n\n2. **Horizontal Line Test:** Use the horizontal line test to determine the number of solutions for a given y-value (or f(x) = c). A horizontal line intersects the graph at points where x is a solution to f(x) = c.\n\n3. **Counting Intersections:** For each integer value of c, count the number of intersections between the horizontal line y = c and the graph of f(x). This will give you the number of solutions for that particular c.\n\n4. **Summation of Solutions:** Identify which integer values of c result in exactly 6 solutions. Sum these values to find the final answer.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the scale and units of the graph, as well as any specific features of the function that might affect the number of solutions.\n\nBy applying these concepts, you can systematically determine the sum of all integers c for which f(x) = c has exactly 6 solutions."}
