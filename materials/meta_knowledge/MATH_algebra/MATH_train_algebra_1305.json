{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Equations:** Recognize that the given equation is a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the solutions.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions:** When simplifying the solutions, ensure that the expressions under the square root and in the numerator and denominator are correct. This includes correctly identifying \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the quadratic equation.\n\n3. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** Ensure that the values of \\( m \\), \\( n \\), and \\( p \\) have a GCD of 1. This means that after finding the solutions, you must simplify them to their simplest form where no common factor other than 1 exists between \\( m \\), \\( n \\), and \\( p \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when calculating the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) and simplifying the resulting expressions. Errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect values for \\( m \\), \\( n \\), and \\( p \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( m \\), \\( n \\), and \\( p \\), verify that their sum \\( m + n + p \\) is correct by substituting the simplified solutions back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
