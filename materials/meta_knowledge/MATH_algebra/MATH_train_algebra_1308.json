{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Use of Identities:** Recognize and apply algebraic identities where possible. For example, \\((x-2)(x+2)\\) is a form of the difference of squares, which simplifies to \\(x^2 - 4\\).\n\n2. **Sequential Expansion:** Expand the expression step by step. Start by combining \\((x-2)(x+2)\\) first, then multiply the result by \\(x^2 + 4\\). This approach helps manage complexity and reduces the chance of errors.\n\n3. **Careful Multiplication:** When multiplying polynomials, ensure each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Use a systematic method like the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last) for binomials or a grid for larger polynomials.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After expanding, combine like terms carefully. This step is crucial as it simplifies the expression and corrects any multiplication errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your expanded form by substituting simple values of x (like x = 0, 1, or -1) into both the original and expanded expressions to check if they yield the same results.\n\nThese strategies will help minimize errors and ensure accuracy in expanding complex polynomial expressions."}
