{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Nested Roots:** Recognize that the expression involves a nested root, specifically a cube root inside a square root. Understand the properties of cube roots and square roots separately and how they interact.\n\n2. **Integer Conditions:** Identify the conditions under which the expression \\(\\sqrt{144 - \\sqrt[3]{x}}\\) is an integer. This implies that \\(144 - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\) must be a perfect square.\n\n3. **Range of \\(x\\):** Since \\(x\\) is non-negative, \\(\\sqrt[3]{x}\\) ranges from 0 to infinity. Ensure that \\(144 - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\) remains non-negative, which sets a limit on the values of \\(\\sqrt[3]{x}\\).\n\n4. **Perfect Square Analysis:** Determine the range of values for \\(144 - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\) that are perfect squares. This involves finding integers \\(k\\) such that \\(k^2 = 144 - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\).\n\n5. **Solving for \\(x\\):** From the equation \\(k^2 = 144 - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\), solve for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(k\\). This will help in counting the number of valid \\(x\\) values.\n\n6. **Verification:** After determining potential values of \\(x\\), verify each one by substituting back into the original expression to confirm it yields an integer.\n\nThese points will help in systematically approaching and solving the problem with minimal errors."}
