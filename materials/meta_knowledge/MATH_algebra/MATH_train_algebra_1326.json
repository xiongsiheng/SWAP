{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fraction Division:** Remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. For example, \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{d}{c}\\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting values into expressions, ensure that you substitute correctly and simplify step by step to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n3. **Common Denominators:** If necessary, find a common denominator to combine fractions correctly. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex fractions.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing operations, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with fractions.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have your final answer, verify it by substituting back into the original expression to confirm it is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
