{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the slope of a line perpendicular to a given line, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope of a Line:** The slope of a line in the form \\(Ax + By = C\\) can be found using the formula \\(m = -\frac{A}{B}\\).\n\n2. **Perpendicular Slopes:** The slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the original line's slope. If the slope of the original line is \\(m\\), the slope of the perpendicular line is \\(-\frac{1}{m}\\).\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that you accurately calculate the slope of the given line before finding the negative reciprocal. Small errors in the initial slope calculation will propagate.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the slope and its negative reciprocal carefully to avoid arithmetic mistakes.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by checking if the product of the slopes of the original and perpendicular lines equals \\(-1\\), which is a property of perpendicular slopes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
