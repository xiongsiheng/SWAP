{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Understand the methods for solving quadratic equations, such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Ensure that you correctly identify the coefficients (a, b, and c) in the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant Analysis:** Calculate the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) to determine the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex). This helps in understanding the possible values of the variable.\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** When simplifying expressions, especially those involving square roots or fractions, ensure that you maintain the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving for the variable, substitute the solutions back into the original equation to verify they are valid. This step is crucial to avoid extraneous solutions.\n\n5. **Minimizing Expressions:** When asked for the smallest possible value of an expression, consider the range of values the variable can take based on the solutions of the equation. Use algebraic manipulation to express the given expression in a simpler form if necessary.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
