{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Multiplication of Constants:** Multiply the constants together first. In this case, multiply 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** When multiplying powers of the same variable, add the exponents together. For example, \\(a \\cdot a^2 = a^{1+2} = a^3\\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations, which in this case involves multiplying the constants first and then combining the powers of \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Exponent Rules:** Use the rule \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) to combine the exponents of \\(a\\).\n\n5. **Final Expression:** Write the final expression with the combined constant and the summed exponent of \\(a\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying such expressions."}
