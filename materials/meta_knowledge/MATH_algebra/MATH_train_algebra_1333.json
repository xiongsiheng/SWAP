{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding products of binomials, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials) to multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. Specifically, multiply the First terms, Outside terms, Inside terms, and Last terms.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** After distributing, combine any like terms. In the case of \\((x+2)(x+5)\\), you will combine the \\(x^2\\) term, the \\(x\\) terms (which are \\(2x\\) and \\(5x\\)), and the constant terms (which are \\(2 \\cdot 5\\)).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that you perform the arithmetic correctly, especially when adding or multiplying coefficients.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to avoid errors in calculation.\n\n5. **Double-Check Work:** After completing the expansion, double-check your work to ensure that each step was performed correctly and that the final expression is simplified properly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding binomial products."}
