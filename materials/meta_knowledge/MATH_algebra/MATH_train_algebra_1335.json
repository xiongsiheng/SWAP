{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving custom operations like $\\#$, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation Definition:** Clearly understand and apply the definition of the operation as given. In this case, $a \\# b = a + \\frac{a}{b}$.\n\n2. **Substitute Values Correctly:** Substitute the given values for $a$ and $b$ into the operation definition without altering the structure of the operation.\n\n3. **Perform Fractions Carefully:** When dealing with fractions, ensure that you simplify and calculate them accurately. For instance, $\frac{a}{b}$ should be calculated by dividing $a$ by $b$.\n\n4. **Check Arithmetic Operations:** Double-check all arithmetic operations (addition, division) to avoid simple mistakes that can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the result, it can be helpful to re-evaluate the operation with the given values to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving custom operations."}
