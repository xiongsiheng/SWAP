{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Quadratic:** Recognize that the vertex form of a quadratic equation is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex of the parabola. Given that the maximum value occurs at \\(x = 3\\), the vertex is \\((3, 5)\\).\n\n2. **Using the Vertex:** Substitute the vertex into the vertex form to get \\( y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5 \\).\n\n3. **Using Given Points:** Use the point \\((0, -13)\\) to find the value of \\(a\\). Substitute \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = -13\\) into the equation \\( y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5 \\) and solve for \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Finding \\(m\\):** Once \\(a\\) is determined, use the equation \\( y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5 \\) to find the value of \\(m\\) when \\(x = 4\\). Substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the equation and calculate \\(y\\).\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic and substitutions to ensure accuracy, as errors in these steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
