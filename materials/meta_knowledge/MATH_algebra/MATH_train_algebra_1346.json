{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for \\( h(x) \\) in this type of polynomial equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Isolate \\( h(x) \\):** Start by isolating \\( h(x) \\) on one side of the equation. This typically involves subtracting or adding the other terms from both sides.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** Ensure that you correctly combine like terms. This means adding or subtracting coefficients of terms with the same degree.\n\n3. **Order of Terms:** When expressing \\( h(x) \\), write the terms in order of decreasing degree as specified in the problem. This helps in clearly presenting the polynomial.\n\n4. **Check Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with coefficients and exponents, as these can be common sources of error.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, substitute \\( h(x) \\) back into the original equation to verify that both sides are equal, which helps confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( h(x) \\) in polynomial equations."}
