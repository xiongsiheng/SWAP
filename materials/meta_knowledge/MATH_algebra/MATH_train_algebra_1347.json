{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recognize that the distances the ball travels after each bounce form a geometric sequence. The first term (a) is the initial height, and the common ratio (r) is given by the fraction of the preceding height the ball reaches after each bounce.\n\n2. **Sum of Geometric Series:** Use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series, \\( S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \\), where \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Considering Both Directions:** Remember to account for both the distance the ball travels downward and upward. Each bounce involves a downward motion (equal to the height reached on the previous bounce) and an upward motion (equal to the height reached after the current bounce).\n\n4. **Calculating Total Distance:** The total distance traveled includes the initial drop and the sum of the distances for each bounce in both directions. Ensure you calculate and add these distances correctly.\n\n5. **Rounding Correctly:** When rounding to the nearest meter, ensure you apply the rounding rules accurately to avoid final answer discrepancies.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
