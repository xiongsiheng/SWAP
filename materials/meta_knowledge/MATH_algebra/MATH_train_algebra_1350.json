{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For example, if you have functions \\(\\delta(x)\\) and \\(\\phi(x)\\), then \\(\\delta(\\phi(x))\\) means you first apply \\(\\phi(x)\\) and then use the result as the input for \\(\\delta(x)\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting one function into another, ensure that you substitute correctly. For instance, if \\(\\phi(x) = 8x + 7\\), then \\(\\delta(\\phi(x)) = \\delta(8x + 7)\\).\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when solving for a variable. Ensure that you isolate the variable correctly and that your steps are logically consistent.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify your solution by substituting it back into the original equation to confirm that it satisfies the given condition.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the coefficients and constants involved in the functions, as errors in these can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
