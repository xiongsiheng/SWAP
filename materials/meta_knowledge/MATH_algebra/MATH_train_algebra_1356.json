{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of a series of odd integers, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:** Recognize that the sequence of odd integers from 11 to 39 is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.\n\n2. **Determine the First and Last Terms:** Identify the first term (11) and the last term (39) of the sequence.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Terms:** Use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: \\(n = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1\\), where \\(l\\) is the last term, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(d\\) is the common difference (2 in this case).\n\n4. **Sum of Arithmetic Sequence:** Apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: \\(S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\\), where \\(S\\) is the sum, \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\n5. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for the number of terms and the sum to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify the sum by manually adding a few terms at the beginning and end of the sequence to ensure consistency.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy in calculating the sum of the odd integers from 11 through 39."}
