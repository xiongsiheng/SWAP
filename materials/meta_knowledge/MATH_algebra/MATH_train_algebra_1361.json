{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identifying the Nature of the Equation:** Recognize that this is a quadratic equation disguised as a simple algebraic manipulation problem. Understanding the structure helps in applying the correct solution method.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Equation:** Start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation using the formula for squaring a binomial: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). This will help in setting up the equation in a standard quadratic form.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Once the equation is in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), use appropriate methods to solve it, such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, verify that each solution satisfies the original equation. This step is crucial as squaring both sides of an equation can introduce solutions that do not satisfy the original equation.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients during simplification and solving. Errors often occur in handling these elements.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
