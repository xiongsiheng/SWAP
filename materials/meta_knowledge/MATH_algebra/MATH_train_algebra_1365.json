{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have exactly one solution, the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) must be equal to zero. In this case, \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = n\\), and \\(c = 1\\).\n\n2. **Calculating the Discriminant:** Set up the discriminant equation \\(n^2 - 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 = 0\\) and solve for \\(n\\). This simplifies to \\(n^2 - 36 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(n\\):** Solve the equation \\(n^2 = 36\\) to find the values of \\(n\\). Remember to consider only the positive value of \\(n\\) as specified in the problem.\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the value of \\(n\\) you find indeed makes the discriminant zero, confirming that the quadratic equation has exactly one solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
