{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** Remember that Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(r_1 + r_2\\) is \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the roots \\(r_1 \\cdot r_2\\) is \\(\frac{c}{a}\\).\n\n2. **Reciprocals of Roots:** The sum of the reciprocals of the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) can be found using the relationship \\(\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2} = \frac{r_1 + r_2}{r_1 \\cdot r_2}\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform arithmetic operations accurately, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, as these can be prone to calculation errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when substituting values into formulas, to ensure that no mistakes have been made.\n\n5. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand what the problem is asking. In this case, it's asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the roots, not the roots themselves or their sum or product.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
