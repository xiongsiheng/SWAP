{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Polynomial Multiplication:** When multiplying polynomials, use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to ensure each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Matching Coefficients:** After multiplying, match the coefficients of the resulting polynomial with the given polynomial. This helps in identifying the values of the unknown variables (in this case, \\(g\\) and \\(h\\)).\n\n3. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the coefficients of like terms from the given polynomial and the polynomial you derived from multiplication. Solve this system to find the values of \\(g\\) and \\(h\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when combining like terms or multiplying coefficients, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the values of \\(g\\) and \\(h\\), substitute them back into the original polynomials and multiply them again to ensure the product matches the given polynomial. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
