{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing differences of squares mentally, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Use the Difference of Squares Formula:** The difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\), can simplify the calculation significantly. Identify \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and apply the formula directly.\n\n2. **Quick Addition and Subtraction:** After applying the formula, perform the addition and subtraction quickly and accurately. For example, in \\(55^2 - 45^2\\), \\(a = 55\\) and \\(b = 45\\), so \\((55 + 45)(55 - 45) = 100 \times 10\\).\n\n3. **Mental Math Techniques:** Practice mental math techniques for multiplying and adding large numbers quickly. For instance, \\(100 \times 10\\) is straightforward.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the mental calculations, double-check the steps to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with larger numbers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while performing such calculations mentally."}
