{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients and the variables. In this case, both coefficients (55 and 121) are divisible by 11, and the variable \\( z \\) appears in both terms with the lowest exponent being 17.\n\n2. **Factor Out the GCF:** Once you identify the GCF, factor it out of each term. For example, \\( 55z^{17} \\) can be factored as \\( 11z^{17} \times 5 \\), and \\( 121z^{34} \\) as \\( 11z^{17} \times 11z^{17} \\).\n\n3. **Check Your Factored Form:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure you get the original expression. This step helps verify that your factoring is correct.\n\n4. **Simplify Remaining Terms:** If there are any remaining terms inside the parentheses after factoring out the GCF, simplify them as needed.\n\n5. **Consistency in Notation:** Ensure consistent use of parentheses and signs to avoid errors in algebraic manipulation.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate factoring of the expression."}
