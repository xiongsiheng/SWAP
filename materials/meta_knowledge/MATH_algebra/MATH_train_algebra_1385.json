{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving custom operations like $\\odot$, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation Definition:** Clearly understand and apply the definition of the operation as given. In this case, $a \\odot b = a + \\frac{3a}{2b}$. Ensure you substitute the values correctly into the formula.\n\n2. **Simplify Step-by-Step:** Simplify the expression step-by-step to avoid errors. Start by substituting the values for $a$ and $b$, then proceed with the arithmetic operations.\n\n3. **Check Fractions:** When dealing with fractions, ensure that you correctly simplify and combine them. Pay attention to the denominator and numerator, especially when multiplying or dividing.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each operation, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy. Simple arithmetic mistakes can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you obtain a result, verify it by substituting back into the original operation definition to confirm it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when dealing with custom operations."}
