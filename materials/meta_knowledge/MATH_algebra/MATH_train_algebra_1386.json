{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given equation is a quadratic equation representing the height of a projectile over time. The general form is \\(y = at^2 + bt + c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find the time at which the projectile reaches a specific height, set \\(y\\) equal to that height (in this case, 28 meters) and solve for \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use the quadratic formula \\(t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to solve for \\(t\\). Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the equation.\n\n4. **Interpreting Roots:** When you find the roots of the quadratic equation, consider the context of the problem. For a projectile, only positive time values are meaningful. Choose the smallest positive root if both roots are positive.\n\n5. **Checking Units:** Ensure that all units are consistent and correct. For example, if velocities are in meters per second, time should be in seconds, and height in meters.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the calculated time back into the original equation to verify that the height is indeed 28 meters. This step helps catch any algebraic or computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
