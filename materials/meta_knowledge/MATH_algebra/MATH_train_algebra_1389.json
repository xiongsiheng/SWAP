{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation involving absolute values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. The expression \\(|n + 6|\\) represents the distance of \\(n + 6\\) from 0 on the number line.\n\n2. **Case Analysis:** Absolute value equations typically require solving for different cases. For \\(|n + 6| = 2 - n\\), consider the cases where \\(n + 6 \\geq 0\\) and \\(n + 6 < 0\\).\n\n3. **Solving Each Case:** For each case, remove the absolute value and solve the resulting equation. Ensure that the solutions satisfy the condition of the case.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, substitute them back into the original equation to verify they are valid solutions.\n\n5. **Avoiding Extraneous Solutions:** Solutions that do not satisfy the original equation's conditions are extraneous. Always check to ensure your solutions are not extraneous.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
