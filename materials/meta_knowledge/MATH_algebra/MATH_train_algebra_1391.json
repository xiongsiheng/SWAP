{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions like $x^5 - 5x$ for a given value of $x$, consider the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when substituting and calculating. For this problem, first substitute $x = 4$ into the expression, then perform the exponentiation before the subtraction.\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** Double-check that you have substituted the correct value of $x$ into the expression. A common error is substituting the wrong number or missing a digit.\n\n3. **Calculation Precision:** Pay close attention to each step of the calculation, especially when dealing with exponents and multiplications. Small mistakes in these areas can significantly alter the result.\n\n4. **Use of Calculator:** If using a calculator, ensure you input the expression correctly and use parentheses where necessary to maintain the correct order of operations.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating, it can be helpful to quickly re-evaluate the expression mentally or with a calculator to confirm the result.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in evaluating such expressions."}
