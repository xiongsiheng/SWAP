{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the bacteria population is growing exponentially. The formula for exponential growth is \\( N(t) = N_0 \times 2^{t/T} \\), where \\( N(t) \\) is the number of bacteria at time \\( t \\), \\( N_0 \\) is the initial number of bacteria, and \\( T \\) is the doubling time.\n\n2. **Time Calculation:** Accurately calculate the total time elapsed. In this case, from 3:00 p.m. to 3:15 p.m., 15 minutes have passed. Divide this by the doubling time (3 minutes) to find how many times the population doubles.\n\n3. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you correctly calculate the number of doublings and apply the exponential growth formula accurately. Missteps in either can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your calculations by manually checking the population at each doubling interval (every 3 minutes) to ensure consistency with the exponential growth pattern.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving exponential growth."}
