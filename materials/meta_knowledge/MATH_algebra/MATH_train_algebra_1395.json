{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the range of the product of two functions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ranges:** Recall that the range of a function is the set of all possible output values. For the product of two functions, the range will depend on the ranges of the individual functions.\n\n2. **Maximizing Products:** To find the largest possible value of the product, consider the maximum values of each function and how they interact. The maximum product is typically achieved by multiplying the highest possible positive values or the lowest possible negative values.\n\n3. **Negative Values:** Be mindful of negative values, as multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number. Ensure you consider both positive and negative extremes.\n\n4. **Combining Ranges:** Use the given ranges of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) to determine the possible values of \\( f(x) \\cdot g(x) \\). This involves considering all combinations of values from the ranges of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by ensuring that all combinations of values from the ranges of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are considered. This will help avoid overlooking potential maximum values.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can more accurately determine the largest possible value of \\( b \\) for the range of \\( f(x) \\cdot g(x) \\)."}
