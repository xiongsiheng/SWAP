{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is given by \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the coordinates into the formula. Pay attention to which coordinates are \\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(y_2\\).\n\n3. **Squaring Coordinates:** When squaring the differences \\((x_2 - x_1)\\) and \\((y_2 - y_1)\\), make sure to square each term separately before adding them together.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Square Root:** After calculating the sum inside the square root, simplify the square root if possible. Ensure that you are taking the positive square root, as distance cannot be negative.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Recheck your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to avoid common errors in calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating the distance between two points."}
