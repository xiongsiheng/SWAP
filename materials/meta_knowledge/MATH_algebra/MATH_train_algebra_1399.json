{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying polynomial expressions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly by multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside. For example, \\(x(3x^2 - 2)\\) becomes \\(3x^3 - 2x\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After distributing, combine like terms. Terms with the same variable raised to the same power should be grouped together. For example, \\(3x^3\\) and \\(Bx^3\\) can be combined.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) are performed accurately. Pay special attention to signs, especially when subtracting polynomials.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) correctly, which means performing multiplication before addition or subtraction.\n\n5. **Final Expression Form:** Ensure that the final expression is in the standard form \\(Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D\\), where coefficients \\(A, B, C,\\) and \\(D\\) are simplified and ordered from highest to lowest power of \\(x\\).\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure the correct simplification of polynomial expressions."}
