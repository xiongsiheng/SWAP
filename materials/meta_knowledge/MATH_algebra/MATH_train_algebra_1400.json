{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating the Equation:** Clearly express the relationship given in the problem. For instance, if the number is \\( x \\), then the problem states \\( x + x^2 = 156 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Recognize that this is a quadratic equation (\\( x^2 + x - 156 = 0 \\)). Use appropriate methods to solve it, such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.\n\n3. **Checking for Positive Solutions:** Since the problem specifies a positive number, ensure that any solution you find is positive. Discard any negative solutions.\n\n4. **Verification:** Substitute your solution back into the original problem to confirm that it satisfies the conditions given. This step is crucial to ensure the accuracy of your solution.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and operations in your calculations to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
