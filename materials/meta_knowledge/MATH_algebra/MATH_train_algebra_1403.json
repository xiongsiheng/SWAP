{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving inverse functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Inverse Function:** The inverse function \\( f^{-1} \\) reverses the operations of \\( f \\). Specifically, if \\( f(a) = b \\), then \\( f^{-1}(b) = a \\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** When evaluating expressions involving inverse functions, substitute the given values directly. For example, if \\( f(3) = 4 \\), then \\( f^{-1}(4) = 3 \\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations when combining multiple inverse function evaluations. Perform the inner evaluations first before combining the results.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the values you use for substitution are consistent with the given function values. Mistakes often occur when incorrect values are substituted.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the final answer, consider verifying it by checking if the function and its inverse operations align correctly with the given values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inverse functions."}
