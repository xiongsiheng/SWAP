{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Composite Functions:** A composite function \\( f(f(x)) \\) means applying the function \\( f \\) twice. First, find \\( f(x) \\) for a given \\( x \\), and then find \\( f \\) of that result.\n\n2. **Graphical Analysis:** Use the graph to determine where \\( f(x) = 2 \\). This will help identify the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( f(f(x)) = 2 \\). Look for intersections of the horizontal line \\( y = 2 \\) with the graph of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n3. **Systematic Approach:** Start by identifying all \\( x \\) values where \\( f(x) = 2 \\). Then, for each of these \\( x \\) values, determine \\( f(x) \\) again to see if it equals 2. This step-by-step approach helps avoid missing any solutions.\n\n4. **Verification:** After identifying potential solutions, verify each one by checking if \\( f(f(x)) = 2 \\) holds True. This step ensures accuracy and helps catch any misinterpretations of the graph.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the range of \\( x \\) values given (from -4 to 4 inclusive) and ensure all calculations and interpretations are within this range.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
