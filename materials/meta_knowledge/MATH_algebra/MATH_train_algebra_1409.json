{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Quadratics:** When factoring a quadratic expression like \\(12y^2 - 65y + 42\\), look for two numbers that multiply to the product of the coefficient of \\(y^2\\) and the constant term (i.e., \\(12 \times 42\\)), and whose sum is the coefficient of \\(y\\) (i.e., \\(-65\\)).\n\n2. **Checking Factors:** Ensure that the factors you choose correctly match the quadratic expression. For example, if you find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\((Ay - 14)(By - 3)\\) equals \\(12y^2 - 65y + 42\\), verify that the product of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) equals the coefficient of \\(y^2\\) (i.e., 12) and that the sum of the products of \\(A\\) with \\(-3\\) and \\(B\\) with \\(-14\\) equals \\(-65\\).\n\n3. **Calculating \\(AB + A\\):** Once you have determined \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), calculate \\(AB + A\\) carefully. This involves multiplying \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) together and then adding \\(A\\) to the result. Ensure that you perform these operations accurately to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with multiplications and additions, as these are common sources of errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** If possible, substitute the factors back into the original expression to ensure they correctly represent the quadratic. This step can help catch any errors in the factoring process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
