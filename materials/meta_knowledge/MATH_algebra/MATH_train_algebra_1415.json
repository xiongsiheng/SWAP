{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perfect Squares:** Recall that a perfect square is the square of an integer, such as \\(1^2 = 1\\), \\(2^2 = 4\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), etc. Recognizing and generating perfect squares is crucial.\n\n2. **Formulating the Problem:** Express the problem algebraically. If the two perfect squares are \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) with \\(a > b\\), then the difference is given by \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\). This can be factored as \\((a - b)(a + b) = 133\\).\n\n3. **Factorization:** Since 133 is a product of two factors, identify all pairs of integers whose product is 133. These pairs are \\((1, 133)\\) and \\((7, 19)\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):** For each pair of factors, solve the system of equations \\(a - b = m\\) and \\(a + b = n\\) to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This involves adding and subtracting the equations to isolate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:** Once \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined, calculate the sum of the squares \\(a^2 + b^2\\). Ensure that the sum is minimized, as the problem asks for the smallest possible sum.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and ensure that the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) satisfy the original condition \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
