{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when converting repeating decimals to fractions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up the Equation:** Let the repeating decimal be equal to a variable, say \\( x \\). For example, if the repeating decimal is \\( 0.\\overline{73} \\), write \\( x = 0.\\overline{73} \\).\n\n2. **Multiplying to Align the Repeats:** Multiply both sides of the equation by a power of 10 that aligns the repeating part to the decimal point. For \\( 0.\\overline{73} \\), multiply by 100 (since the repeat length is 2 digits) to get \\( 100x = 73.\\overline{73} \\).\n\n3. **Subtracting the Equations:** Subtract the original equation from this new equation to eliminate the repeating part. For example, subtract \\( x = 0.\\overline{73} \\) from \\( 100x = 73.\\overline{73} \\) to get \\( 99x = 73 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\):** Solve the resulting equation for \\( x \\) to find the fraction. In this case, \\( x = \frac{73}{99} \\).\n\n5. **Simplifying the Fraction:** If necessary, simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and dividing both by the GCD.\n\n6. **Verification:** Convert the fraction back to a decimal to verify that it matches the original repeating decimal. This step ensures the accuracy of the conversion.\n\nThese steps help ensure that you correctly convert repeating decimals to fractions with minimal errors."}
