{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Define Variables Clearly:** Assign clear and consistent variables to each person's age. For example, let \\( B \\) represent Brenda's age, \\( A \\) represent Addison's age, and \\( J \\) represent Janet's age.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Based on Relationships:** Translate the given relationships into mathematical equations. For instance, if Addison's age is three times Brenda's age, you can write \\( A = 3B \\). Similarly, if Janet is six years older than Brenda, you can write \\( J = B + 6 \\).\n\n3. **Use Logical Consistency:** Ensure that all parts of the problem are logically consistent. For example, if Addison and Janet are twins, their ages must be equal, so \\( A = J \\).\n\n4. **Solve the System of Equations:** Combine the equations to solve for the unknown variable. In this case, substitute the expressions for \\( A \\) and \\( J \\) into the equation \\( A = J \\) to find \\( B \\).\n\n5. **Verify Your Solution:** After finding Brenda's age, substitute it back into the original relationships to ensure they hold True. This step helps verify the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
