{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating average speed for a round trip, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Average Speed:** Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. It is not the average of the speeds for each segment of the trip.\n\n2. **Calculating Total Distance:** Ensure you correctly calculate the total distance for the round trip. In this case, since Mary walks 1 km uphill and 1 km downhill, the total distance is 2 km.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Time:** Accurately sum the total time taken for both segments of the trip. Here, it is 30 minutes uphill plus 10 minutes downhill, totaling 40 minutes.\n\n4. **Converting Time to Hours:** Since speed is typically measured in km/hr, convert the total time from minutes to hours. For example, 40 minutes is equivalent to 40/60 or 2/3 of an hour.\n\n5. **Applying the Formula:** Use the formula for average speed: \\( \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \\). Plug in the values you've calculated to find the average speed.\n\n6. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Recheck your calculations for any arithmetic errors, especially when converting units and performing division.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors in calculating average speed for such problems."}
