{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Place Value:** Recognize that $\\underline{3\\Theta}$ represents a two-digit number where '3' is in the tens place and $\\Theta$ is in the ones place. This means $\\underline{3\\Theta}$ can be expressed as $30 + \\Theta$.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Translate the given problem into a mathematical equation. In this case, $252/\\Theta = 30 + \\Theta + \\Theta$, which simplifies to $252/\\Theta = 30 + 2\\Theta$.\n\n3. **Solving for $\\Theta$:** To find $\\Theta$, you need to isolate it. This might involve multiplying both sides of the equation by $\\Theta$ to eliminate the fraction, and then solving the resulting quadratic equation.\n\n4. **Checking for Valid Digits:** Remember that $\\Theta$ must be a single digit (0-9). Ensure that any solution you find is within this range.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your solution back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the conditions of the problem. This step is crucial to ensure the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
