{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perimeter and Area:** Ensure you understand the relationship between the perimeter of a rectangle (which is given as the fencing length) and its area. The perimeter formula is \\(P = 2l + 2w\\), and the area formula is \\(A = lw\\).\n\n2. **Maximizing Area:** For a given perimeter, the area of a rectangle is maximized when the rectangle is a square. This means the length and width should be equal.\n\n3. **Calculating Dimensions:** Calculate the dimensions of the square by dividing the total perimeter by 4 (since a square has four equal sides).\n\n4. **Area Calculation:** Once you have the side length of the square, calculate the area using the area formula for a square, which is \\(A = s^2\\), where \\(s\\) is the side length.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations for the side length and area to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
