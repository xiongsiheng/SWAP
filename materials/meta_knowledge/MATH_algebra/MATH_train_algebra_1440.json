{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inequalities:** Ensure you correctly interpret the inequality. In this case, \\(100 \\leq x^2 \\leq 200\\) means \\(x^2\\) must lie between 100 and 200, inclusive.\n\n2. **Finding Bounds:** Determine the smallest and largest integers \\(x\\) that satisfy the inequality. This involves solving \\(x^2 \\geq 100\\) and \\(x^2 \\leq 200\\) separately.\n\n3. **Square Root Calculation:** When finding the bounds, correctly calculate the square roots of 100 and 200. Remember that \\(\\sqrt{100} = 10\\) and \\(\\sqrt{200} \u0007pprox 14.14\\), so \\(x\\) must be an integer between 10 and 14.14.\n\n4. **Counting Integers:** Count the integers within the range [10, 14]. This includes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your count by ensuring each integer in the range satisfies the original inequality \\(100 \\leq x^2 \\leq 200\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
