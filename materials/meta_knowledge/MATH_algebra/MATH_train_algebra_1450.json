{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** The inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) of \\( f(x) \\) is defined such that \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\). For a function like \\( f(x) = 2x - 5 \\), you can find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) by solving for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) where \\( y = f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find when \\( f(x) = f^{-1}(x) \\), set the function equal to its inverse and solve for \\( x \\). This involves expressing both sides of the equation in a comparable form.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with linear equations. Errors often occur in simple steps like distributing, combining like terms, or isolating variables.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the value of \\( x \\), substitute it back into both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) to verify that they are indeed equal. This step ensures that the solution satisfies the original condition.\n\n5. **Graphical Understanding:** Optionally, understanding the graphical representation of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) can help visualize the point of intersection, which is where \\( f(x) = f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
