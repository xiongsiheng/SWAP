{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Formulate the problem correctly using algebraic equations. For this problem, let the two integers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) where \\( x > y \\). The equations are \\( x - y = 12 \\) and \\( xy = 45 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve the system of equations. For instance, express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) from the first equation and substitute into the second equation.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, as specified in the problem.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum:** After finding the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), calculate their sum directly.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations and verify that the solutions satisfy both the original equations (difference and product).\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving such problems."}
