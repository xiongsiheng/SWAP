{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ceiling and Floor Functions:** The ceiling function \\(\\lceil y \\rceil\\) returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(y\\), and the floor function \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor\\) returns the largest integer less than or equal to \\(y\\). For \\(y < 0\\), \\(\\lceil y \\rceil\\) will be \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor + 1\\).\n\n2. **Product of Ceiling and Floor:** Given \\(\\lceil y \\rceil \\cdot \\lfloor y \\rfloor = 110\\), recognize that both \\(\\lceil y \\rceil\\) and \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor\\) must be integers whose product equals 110. Identify pairs of integers that satisfy this condition.\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** When expressing the range of \\(y\\), use interval notation correctly. For negative values, ensure the interval starts from the smaller number (more negative) to the larger number (less negative), and include the correct brackets (open or closed) based on whether the endpoints are included.\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Ensure that the values of \\(y\\) you find are within the given condition \\(y < 0\\). This means the upper bound of your interval should be just below zero.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the boundary values back into the original equation to confirm they satisfy the condition \\(\\lceil y \\rceil \\cdot \\lfloor y \\rfloor = 110\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
