{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** Recognize that the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 14x + 48y\\) can be transformed into a more manageable form by completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This technique helps in identifying the geometric shape (in this case, a circle) and its properties.\n\n2. **Understanding the Geometry:** After completing the square, you should understand that the equation represents a circle centered at \\((h, k)\\) with radius \\(r\\). The minimum value of \\(y\\) corresponds to the lowest point on the circle.\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry:** Use the properties of circles in coordinate geometry to determine the minimum \\(y\\)-value. The minimum \\(y\\)-value occurs at the bottom of the circle, which is directly below the center by the radius amount.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that calculations involving completing the square and determining the center and radius of the circle are done accurately to avoid errors in the final answer.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by substituting the calculated minimum \\(y\\)-value back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
