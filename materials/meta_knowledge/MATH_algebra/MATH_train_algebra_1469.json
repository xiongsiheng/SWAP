{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance between two points on a Cartesian coordinate plane, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the coordinates into the formula. Pay attention to the signs of the coordinates, especially if they are negative.\n\n3. **Squaring Correctly:** When squaring the differences \\((x_2 - x_1)\\) and \\((y_2 - y_1)\\), make sure to square both the positive and negative values correctly.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Square Root:** After calculating the sum of the squares, simplify the square root accurately to get the final distance.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Recheck your arithmetic and algebraic steps to avoid common mistakes in calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating distances between points on a Cartesian coordinate plane."}
