{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have only one solution, the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) must be zero. In this case, \\(b = 20\\), \\(a\\) is given, and \\(c = 7\\). Set up the equation \\(20^2 - 4a \\cdot 7 = 0\\) to find \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\(a\\):** Once you have determined \\(a\\) using the discriminant condition, substitute \\(a\\) back into the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the solution. Since the discriminant is zero, the formula simplifies to \\(x = \frac{-b}{2a}\\).\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** Ensure that you correctly substitute and simplify the values into the quadratic formula. This step is crucial as it directly affects the accuracy of your solution.\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding the solution, substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the condition of being the only solution. This step helps confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
