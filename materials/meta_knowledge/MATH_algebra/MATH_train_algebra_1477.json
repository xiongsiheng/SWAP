{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value inequality $|x - a| \\leq b$ translates to a double inequality: $a - b \\leq x \\leq a + b$.\n\n2. **Applying the Inequality:** Apply the transformation correctly to convert the absolute value inequality into a range for $x$.\n\n3. **Identifying Integer Solutions:** Once you have the range for $x$, determine which integers fall within this range. Count these integers carefully to find the total number of solutions.\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Be cautious of off-by-one errors when counting integers in a range. Ensure that you include both endpoints if they are integers.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking a few integers within the identified range to confirm they satisfy the original inequality.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
