{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying and calculating with radicals, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Product Rule for Radicals:** When multiplying radicals with the same index, you can combine them under a single radical. For example, \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot b}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Radicals:** Always simplify each radical individually before combining them. For example, \\(\\sqrt{75x} = \\sqrt{25 \\cdot 3x} = 5\\sqrt{3x}\\).\n\n3. **Factorization:** Factorize numbers inside the radicals to identify perfect squares or other factors that can be taken out of the radical.\n\n4. **Combining Like Terms:** After simplifying each radical, combine them by multiplying the coefficients outside the radicals and the expressions inside the radicals.\n\n5. **Double-Check Simplification:** Ensure that you have simplified the final expression correctly by checking that no further simplifications are possible.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying and calculating with radicals."}
