{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Recall the midpoint formula, which states that the coordinates of the midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) are given by \\( M\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for the coordinates of point \\( B \\). For example, if \\( M(4, 4) \\) is the midpoint and \\( A(8, 4) \\) is one endpoint, then \\( 4 = \frac{8 + x_2}{2} \\) and \\( 4 = \frac{4 + y_2}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Coordinates:** Solve the equations for \\( x_2 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) to find the coordinates of point \\( B \\). Ensure you perform the arithmetic correctly, especially when dealing with fractions or division.\n\n4. **Sum of Coordinates:** Once you have the coordinates of point \\( B \\), add them together to find the sum. Double-check your addition to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by checking that the midpoint of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) indeed matches the given midpoint \\( M \\). This step can help confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
