{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Domain:** Identify the domain of the function, which is all real numbers except where the denominator is zero. In this case, \\( x \neq -\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Function:** Determine the values of \\( y \\) that cannot be attained by the function. This often involves setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find the unattainable value of \\( y \\), set the denominator of the function equal to zero and solve for \\( y \\). This is because a fraction is undefined when its denominator is zero.\n\n4. **Solving for \\( y \\):** Manipulate the equation to isolate \\( y \\) and find the specific value that is not attainable.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the value you found is indeed not attainable by the function.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
