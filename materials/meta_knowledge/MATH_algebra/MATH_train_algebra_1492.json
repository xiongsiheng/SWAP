{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values for \\( T \\) and \\( H \\) correctly into the formula. Double-check that you are using the correct units if any are provided.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when calculating. This means performing exponentiation before division.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and exponents. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Unit Consistency:** If units are involved, ensure that they are consistent and correctly applied throughout the calculation.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the value of \\( L \\), consider reviewing the steps to ensure no mistakes were made in the process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
