{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation involving absolute values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. For equations like $|x-a| = |x-b|$, this implies that $x$ is equidistant from $a$ and $b$.\n\n2. **Case Analysis:** Absolute value equations often require solving for different cases. For $|x-1| = |x-2|$, consider the cases where each expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative.\n\n3. **Equidistant Points:** Recognize that the solution to $|x-1| = |x-2|$ is the midpoint between the points 1 and 2 on the number line, as $x$ must be equidistant from both.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, substitute them back into the original equation to verify they satisfy the condition.\n\n5. **Fraction Representation:** Ensure that any solution is expressed as a common fraction if required, and simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems involving absolute values."}
