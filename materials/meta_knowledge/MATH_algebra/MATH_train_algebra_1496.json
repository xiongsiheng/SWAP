{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope Formula:** Use the slope formula \\(\\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\) to find the slope of the line between two points. Since the points lie on the same line, the slope between any two pairs of points should be the same.\n\n2. **Consistency of Slopes:** Calculate the slope using different pairs of points and set them equal to each other. This ensures that the points indeed lie on the same line.\n\n3. **Substitution:** Once you have the slope, use it to set up an equation involving the coordinates of the unknown point (in this case, \\((-2, k)\\)) and solve for \\(k\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions, as these can lead to common errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, once you find \\(k\\), you can verify by calculating the slope with the new point and ensuring it matches the previously calculated slopes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
