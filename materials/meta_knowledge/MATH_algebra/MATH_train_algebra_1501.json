{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving inverse functions and their evaluations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** Remember that the inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) returns the value of \\(x\\) for which \\(f(x)\\) equals the given value. For example, \\(f^{-1}(50)\\) is the value of \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = 50\\).\n\n2. **Identifying Values:** Use the provided table to identify the values of \\(x\\) for which \\(f(x)\\) equals the given values. This will help in finding \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) for each specific value.\n\n3. **Performing Calculations:** When performing arithmetic operations with the results of inverse functions, ensure that you are using the correct values from the table. Misreading or misusing the table can lead to incorrect calculations.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions involving multiple inverse functions. This ensures that calculations are performed in the right sequence.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Results:** After calculating the final value, double-check by verifying the steps and ensuring that each inverse function was correctly identified and used in the calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inverse functions and their evaluations."}
