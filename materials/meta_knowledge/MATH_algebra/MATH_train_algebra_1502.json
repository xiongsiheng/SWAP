{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Properties:** Understand that the equation \\(|y| = 2(|y| - 1)\\) involves the absolute value function. Remember that \\(|y|\\) represents the distance of \\(y\\) from zero on the number line, and it is always non-negative.\n\n2. **Solving Absolute Value Equations:** When solving equations involving absolute values, consider the two cases: \\(y \\geq 0\\) and \\(y < 0\\). For each case, remove the absolute value and solve the resulting linear or quadratic equation.\n\n3. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, ensure that each solution satisfies the original equation. Solutions that do not satisfy the original absolute value equation are extraneous and should be discarded.\n\n4. **Product of Solutions:** If the equation results in a quadratic equation, recall that the product of the solutions of \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(\frac{c}{a}\\). This can be useful for directly finding the product without needing to solve for the individual solutions.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be meticulous with arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions, as these can lead to common errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
