{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Remember the formula for the midpoint of a line segment between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\).\n\n2. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). For the square of the distance, you can omit the square root: \\((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\\).\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting coordinates into formulas, ensure that you substitute correctly and simplify expressions step by step to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Solving Equations:** When solving for \\(t\\), isolate \\(t\\) on one side of the equation. Be careful with operations like squaring and dividing, as these can introduce errors if not done correctly.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding a value for \\(t\\), substitute it back into the original conditions to verify that it satisfies the given equation. This step helps confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
