{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying expressions involving nested radicals, consider the following:\n\n1. **Recognize Special Forms:** Look for patterns that suggest the expression might simplify into a recognizable form, such as a sum or difference of squares.\n\n2. **Use Conjugates:** If you encounter expressions of the form \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\(\\sqrt{b}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{a} - \\(\\sqrt{b}\\), multiplying by the conjugate can help simplify the expression.\n\n3. **Square Roots of Squares:** Remember that \\(\\sqrt{x^2} = |x|\\), which means the square root of a squared term is the absolute value of the original term.\n\n4. **Simplify Step-by-Step:** Break down the expression into manageable parts and simplify each part individually before combining them.\n\n5. **Check for Algebraic Identities:** Be aware of algebraic identities that can simplify expressions, such as \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) or \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** After simplifying, double-check your calculations for any arithmetic errors, especially in handling square roots and absolute values.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in simplifying complex radical expressions."}
