{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Before substituting the value of \\( x \\), try to factorize the numerator and the denominator if possible. This can simplify the expression and make the computation easier.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting \\( x = 6 \\), ensure that you substitute correctly into each part of the expression, especially if the expression involves multiple terms or nested expressions.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression after substitution. This includes handling exponents first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with larger numbers or complex expressions, as these are prone to errors.\n\n5. **Simplification:** After substituting and performing the necessary operations, simplify the expression to its simplest form. This often involves canceling out common factors or combining like terms.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while computing such expressions."}
