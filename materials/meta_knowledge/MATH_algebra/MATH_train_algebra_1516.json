{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for partial fractions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Ensure that the denominator is correctly factored. For this problem, \\(x^2 - x - 42\\) factors into \\((x - 7)(x + 6)\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** When setting up the partial fractions, make sure the numerators are of the correct form. Here, you need to express \\(\frac{3x + 5}{(x - 7)(x + 6)}\\) as \\(\frac{A}{x - 7} + \frac{B}{x + 6}\\).\n\n3. **Combining Fractions:** Combine the right-hand side fractions over a common denominator to match the left-hand side. This should give you \\(\frac{A(x + 6) + B(x - 7)}{(x - 7)(x + 6)}\\).\n\n4. **Equating Numerators:** Equate the numerators of both sides of the equation: \\(3x + 5 = A(x + 6) + B(x - 7)\\).\n\n5. **Solving for Constants:** Use the method of comparing coefficients or substituting convenient values for \\(x\\) to solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). For instance, setting \\(x = 7\\) isolates \\(A\\), and setting \\(x = -6\\) isolates \\(B\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), substitute them back into the original setup to verify that the equation holds True. This step ensures that your values for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for partial fractions."}
