{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Sequences:** Ensure you correctly identify the properties of geometric and arithmetic sequences. A geometric sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive terms, while an arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms.\n\n2. **Calculating Terms:** Accurately calculate the terms of each sequence up to the point where they exceed 300. For a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio. For an arithmetic sequence, each term is found by adding the common difference to the previous term.\n\n3. **Finding Differences:** When calculating the least positive difference between any two terms from different sequences, systematically compare each term of one sequence with each term of the other sequence to find the smallest non-negative difference.\n\n4. **Avoiding Oversight:** Be thorough in your comparisons to avoid overlooking any pairs of terms that might yield a smaller difference. This includes checking both directions of subtraction (i.e., \\(a - b\\) and \\(b - a\\)) to ensure you find the absolute least difference.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and comparisons to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with large numbers and multiple terms.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
