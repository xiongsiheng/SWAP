{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Forms:** Recognize that \\(9^{x+2}\\) can be rewritten as \\(3^{2(x+2)}\\) because \\(9 = 3^2\\). This simplifies the comparison between the two sides of the equation.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When the bases are the same, you can set the exponents equal to each other. For example, if \\(3^{A} = 3^{B}\\), then \\(A = B\\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Once you have a quadratic equation in terms of \\(x\\), solve it using the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Sum of Roots of a Quadratic Equation:** The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(-b/a\\), which simplifies finding the sum of all possible values of \\(x\\).\n\n5. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** Although in this type of problem, setting exponents equal to each other usually does not introduce extraneous solutions, it's still good practice to verify that the solutions satisfy the original equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
