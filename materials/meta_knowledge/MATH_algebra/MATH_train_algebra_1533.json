{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving inverse functions and compositions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** Remember that the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) essentially 'undoes' the function \\( f(x) \\). If \\( f(a) = b \\), then \\( f^{-1}(b) = a \\).\n\n2. **Solving for Inverse:** To find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), you need to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) where \\( y = f(x) \\). For example, if \\( f(x) = \frac{24}{x+3} \\), solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Substitution and Equivalence:** When given \\( g(x) = 3f^{-1}(x) \\) and \\( g(x) = 15 \\), substitute \\( 15 \\) for \\( g(x) \\) and solve for \\( x \\). This involves setting up the equation \\( 15 = 3f^{-1}(x) \\) and solving for \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all algebraic manipulations and calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and complex expressions, to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a value for \\( x \\), substitute it back into the original functions to verify that \\( g(x) = 15 \\). This step ensures that your solution is correct and that no errors were made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inverse functions and their compositions."}
