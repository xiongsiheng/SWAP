{"Knowledge": "To determine the smallest value of $c$ such that the function $f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5$ has an inverse function when restricted to the interval $[c, \\infty)$, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** A function has an inverse if and only if it is one-to-one (injective). This means that each output of the function corresponds to exactly one input.\n\n2. **Graphical Interpretation:** The function $f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5$ is a parabola that opens upwards. It is not one-to-one over its entire domain because it fails the horizontal line test (it has a vertex and is symmetric about the line $x = -2$).\n\n3. **Restricting the Domain:** To make the function one-to-one, restrict its domain to the interval where it is strictly increasing or decreasing. For a parabola, this typically means starting from the vertex and extending to infinity.\n\n4. **Finding the Vertex:** The vertex of the parabola $f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5$ is at $x = -2$. This is the point where the function changes from decreasing to increasing.\n\n5. **Choosing the Interval:** To ensure the function is one-to-one, choose the interval starting from the vertex, i.e., $[c, \\infty)$, where $c$ is the x-coordinate of the vertex.\n\nBy applying these concepts, you can determine the smallest value of $c$ that allows $f$ to have an inverse function."}
