{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rate Calculation:** Ensure you correctly calculate the reading rates in terms of pages per minute. For example, Xanthia reads 100 pages per hour, which translates to 100/60 = 1.67 pages per minute, and Molly reads 50 pages per hour, or 50/60 = 0.83 pages per minute.\n\n2. **Time Calculation:** When determining the time it takes each person to read the book, use the formula Time = Total Pages / Reading Rate. For instance, for Xanthia, Time = 225 pages / 1.67 pages per minute, and for Molly, Time = 225 pages / 0.83 pages per minute.\n\n3. **Difference in Time:** Calculate the difference in time between Xanthia and Molly in minutes. This involves subtracting the time it takes Xanthia from the time it takes Molly.\n\n4. **Unit Consistency:** Ensure all calculations are in consistent units (e.g., minutes throughout the problem).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your arithmetic at each step to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
