{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving custom operations like $\\&$ defined in this manner, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation Definition:** Clearly understand and apply the definition of the operation as given. In this case, $a \\& b = (a+b)(a-b)$.\n\n2. **Substitute Values Correctly:** Substitute the given values for $a$ and $b$ into the operation definition without mixing them up.\n\n3. **Perform Arithmetic Carefully:** Ensure that you perform addition and subtraction correctly before multiplying the results. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations after performing the operation to ensure there are no mistakes in addition, subtraction, or multiplication.\n\n5. **Verify the Result:** Optionally, if possible, verify the result by applying the operation in a different manner or using a different set of numbers to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving custom operations."}
