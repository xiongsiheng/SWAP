{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying cube roots like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:** Begin by finding the prime factorization of the number inside the cube root. This helps in identifying groups of three identical factors which can be simplified.\n\n2. **Grouping Factors:** Look for groups of three identical factors within the prime factorization. Each group of three can be taken out of the cube root as a single factor.\n\n3. **Simplification Accuracy:** Ensure that each group of three factors is correctly identified and simplified. Misidentifying groups can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations during the factorization and grouping steps to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Optionally, cube your simplified result to verify it matches the original number inside the cube root. This step confirms the accuracy of your simplification.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in simplifying cube roots."}
