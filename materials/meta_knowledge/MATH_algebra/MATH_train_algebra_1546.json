{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Handling Fractions:** When dealing with fractions, ensure that you correctly find a common denominator and simplify the expressions accurately. Missteps in fraction manipulation can lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** For problems involving multiple equations, use systematic methods like substitution or elimination to solve for the variables. Be consistent in applying these methods to avoid mixing up variables.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After solving for the individual variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions. This step is crucial to ensure that the solution is correct and not just a result of algebraic manipulation.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions. Simple arithmetic errors can significantly impact the final result.\n\n5. **Simplification:** Always simplify expressions to their simplest form. This helps in clearly seeing the relationships between variables and reduces the chances of making mistakes in further calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
