{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of the function \\( g(x) = f(-2x) \\) given the domain of \\( f(x) \\) on \\([-8, 4]\\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Transformation of Variables:** When a function \\( f(x) \\) is transformed to \\( f(kx) \\) (where \\( k \\) is a constant), the domain of the new function \\( g(x) \\) will be affected. Specifically, if \\( k \\) is negative, the direction of the interval boundaries will reverse.\n\n2. **Scaling and Reflection:** In the case of \\( g(x) = f(-2x) \\), the transformation involves both scaling by a factor of 2 and reflecting across the y-axis. This means the original domain \\([-8, 4]\\) will be reflected and scaled.\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** When expressing the domain in interval notation, ensure that the intervals are correctly ordered and that the direction of the inequality signs matches the transformation applied.\n\n4. **Solving for the New Domain:** To find the domain of \\( g(x) \\), solve the inequality \\(-8 \\leq -2x \\leq 4\\). This involves dividing by \\(-2\\) and reversing the inequalities.\n\nBy applying these principles, you can accurately determine the domain of \\( g(x) \\) in interval notation."}
