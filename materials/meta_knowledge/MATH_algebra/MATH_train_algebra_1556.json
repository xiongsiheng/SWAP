{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Use algebraic identities to simplify expressions. For example, knowing that \\((x + \\frac{1}{x})^2 = x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) can help in transforming the given equation into a form that is easier to solve.\n\n2. **Squaring Both Sides:** When you square both sides of an equation, ensure that you include all terms correctly. For instance, \\((x + \\frac{1}{x})^2\\) expands to \\(x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\), not just \\(x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\).\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** After applying an identity, substitute the given value (in this case, \\(x + \\frac{1}{x} = 6\\)) into the new equation and simplify carefully to find the desired value.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with squares and square roots, as these operations are prone to arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Consistency:** Ensure that the steps you take are consistent with the rules of algebra and that each step logically follows from the previous one. This helps in maintaining accuracy throughout the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
