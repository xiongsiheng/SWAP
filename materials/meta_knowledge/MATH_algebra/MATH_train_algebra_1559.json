{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Exponent Rules:** Understand and apply the rules of exponents correctly. For example, \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\).\n\n2. **Base Conversion:** Recognize that \\(27\\) and \\(9\\) can be expressed as powers of \\(3\\): \\(27 = 3^3\\) and \\(9 = 3^2\\).\n\n3. **Equating Exponents:** When two expressions are equal and their bases are the same, their exponents must be equal. This principle is crucial for solving equations like \\(27^8 = 9^q\\).\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Ensure that each step of simplification is logically sound and that you are not inadvertently changing the value of the expression.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After finding the value of \\(q\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that the equality holds. This step is essential to confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
