{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Parallel Lines:** Parallel lines have the same slope. Therefore, if line \\(a\\) is parallel to \\(y = 2x + 4\\), it will also have a slope of 2.\n\n2. **Point-Slope Form:** Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line. This form is useful for finding the equation of a line given its slope and a point.\n\n3. **Substitution:** Substitute the given point \\((2, 5)\\) and the slope \\(2\\) into the point-slope form to find the equation of line \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Slope-Intercept Form:** Convert the equation from point-slope form to slope-intercept form, \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(b\\) is the y-intercept. This will directly give you the y-intercept of line \\(a\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by ensuring that the point \\((2, 5)\\) satisfies the equation of line \\(a\\) and that the slope is indeed 2.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
