{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring quadratic expressions like this one, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognize the Form:** Identify if the quadratic is in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\). Here, \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = -30\\), and \\(c = 25\\).\n\n2. **Check for Perfect Squares:** Look for patterns that suggest the quadratic might be a perfect square trinomial. A perfect square trinomial takes the form \\((ay + b)^2 = a^2y^2 + 2aby + b^2\\).\n\n3. **Coefficient Matching:** For a perfect square trinomial, the middle term \\(b\\) should be twice the product of the square roots of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). Verify if \\(b = 2 \times \\sqrt{a} \times \\sqrt{c}\\).\n\n4. **Verify the Factorization:** Once you factor, expand the factors to ensure they match the original quadratic expression.\n\n5. **Substitute and Check:** Optionally, substitute values of \\(y\\) into the original and factored forms to ensure they yield the same results.\n\nThese steps help ensure accurate factorization and verification of the solution."}
