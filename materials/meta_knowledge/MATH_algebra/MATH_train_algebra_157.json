{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Multiplication of Complex Numbers:** Use the formula \\((a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\\) to multiply complex numbers. Ensure you correctly handle the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\n2. **Conjugate Multiplication:** Recognize that multiplying a complex number by its conjugate (e.g., \\(a + bi\\) and \\(a - bi\\)) results in a real number \\(a^2 + b^2\\). This can simplify calculations.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** When multiplying multiple complex numbers, the order of multiplication does not affect the result due to the associative property of multiplication. However, keep track of each step to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After performing multiplications, simplify the resulting complex number by combining like terms and ensuring the real and imaginary parts are correctly separated.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by substituting back into the problem or using a different method to confirm the multiplication is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving complex numbers."}
