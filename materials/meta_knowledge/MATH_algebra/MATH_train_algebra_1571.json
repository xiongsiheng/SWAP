{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving geometric sequences, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. For a sequence \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots\\), if the common ratio is \\(r\\), then \\(a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r\\) and \\(a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^2\\).\n\n2. **Formulating Equations:** Use the properties of geometric sequences to express terms in terms of the first term and the common ratio. For example, if \\(a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r\\) and \\(a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^2\\), substitute these into the given equation \\(a_3 - b_3 = 2(a_2 - b_2)\\).\n\n3. **Solving for Common Ratios:** Isolate the common ratios in your equations. Since the sequences have different common ratios, denote them as \\(r_1\\) for the first sequence and \\(r_2\\) for the second sequence. Solve the resulting equations to find \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Confusion with Terms:** Ensure that you correctly differentiate between the terms of the two sequences. Mixing up terms from different sequences can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the common ratios, verify your solution by substituting \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds True. This step is crucial to catch any algebraic or conceptual errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving geometric sequences."}
