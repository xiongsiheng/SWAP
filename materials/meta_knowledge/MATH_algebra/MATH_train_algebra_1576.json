{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the x-intercept of a line perpendicular to another line, consider the following:\n\n1. **Slope of Perpendicular Lines:** The slope of a line perpendicular to another is the negative reciprocal of the original line's slope. For example, if the slope of the original line is \\(m\\), the slope of the perpendicular line is \\(-\frac{1}{m}\\).\n\n2. **Equation of a Line:** Use the slope-intercept form of a line, \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept. This form helps in identifying the slope and y-intercept directly.\n\n3. **Finding the Slope:** Convert the given line equation to the slope-intercept form to find its slope. For instance, for \\(3x - 2y = 6\\), rewrite it as \\(y = \frac{3}{2}x - 3\\).\n\n4. **Perpendicular Line Equation:** Once you have the slope of the perpendicular line, use the given y-intercept to form its equation.\n\n5. **X-Intercept Calculation:** The x-intercept occurs where \\(y = 0\\). Set \\(y = 0\\) in the equation of the perpendicular line and solve for \\(x\\).\n\n6. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with fractions or negative numbers, to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\nThese guidelines will help in accurately determining the x-intercept of a line perpendicular to a given line."}
