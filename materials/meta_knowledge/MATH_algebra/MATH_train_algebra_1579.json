{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly, which means multiplying each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. This is often written as \\((a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd\\).\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** After distributing, combine any like terms. This step is crucial to ensure the final expression is simplified.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying terms. Simple arithmetic errors can significantly alter the result.\n\n4. **Check Your Work:** After completing the expansion, it can be helpful to check your work by substituting simple values for x into both the original and expanded expressions to verify they yield the same result.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in the expansion process."}
