{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation $\\S$. In this case, $a\\,\\S\\, b$ is defined as $3a + 5b$.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Substitute the given values into the operation definition. For $7\\,\\S\\,2$, replace $a$ with $7$ and $b$ with $2$ in the expression $3a + 5b$.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that you perform the arithmetic operations accurately. Multiply and add the numbers correctly to avoid simple mistakes.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the operations, double-check your calculations to confirm that no arithmetic errors were made.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
