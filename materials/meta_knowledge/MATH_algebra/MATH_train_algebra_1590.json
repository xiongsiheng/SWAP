{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operator:** Clearly understand the definition of the custom operator (@). In this case, \\(a @ b = 3a - 3b\\). This means you need to substitute \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the formula given.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Substitute the given values (3 and 5) into the formula correctly. Ensure that you substitute each variable (\\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) with the corresponding value.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Perform the arithmetic operations carefully. Multiply and subtract accurately to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Checking the Result:** Optionally, you can check your result by performing the operation in reverse or by using different values to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points will help ensure accuracy and minimize mistakes in solving problems involving custom operators."}
