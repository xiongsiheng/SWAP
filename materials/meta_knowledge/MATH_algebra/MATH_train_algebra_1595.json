{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying polynomial expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Combine Like Terms:** Only terms with the same variable raised to the same power can be combined. For example, \\(3p^3\\) and \\(p^3\\) are like terms, but \\(3p^3\\) and \\(6p^2\\) are not.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations. Typically, you start by combining the highest degree terms first and then move to the lower degree terms.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to addition and subtraction, especially when dealing with negative coefficients, as these can lead to common mistakes.\n\n4. **Final Expression Format:** Arrange the terms in descending order of the power of the variable to match the required form \\(Ap^3 + Bp^2 + Cp + D\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Your Work:** After simplifying, review your work to ensure all terms have been correctly combined and the expression is in the correct format.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying polynomial expressions."}
