{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing the sum of multiple numbers, consider the following:\n\n1. **Grouping for Ease:** Group numbers that add up to multiples of 10 or 100 for easier mental calculations. For example, in this problem, you can group 27 and 3 to make 30, and 139 and 11 to make 150.\n\n2. **Sequential Addition:** Add the numbers sequentially from smallest to largest or vice versa to minimize carrying over and to keep track of the sum more easily.\n\n3. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the addition, double-check your calculations by adding the numbers again in a different order or using a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Use of Complements:** If numbers are close to a multiple of 10 or 100, consider using their complements to simplify the addition. For instance, instead of adding 139 directly, think of it as 140 minus 1.\n\n5. **Practice Mental Math:** Regular practice of mental math can improve speed and accuracy, reducing the likelihood of computational errors.\n\nThese strategies can help ensure that you compute the sum correctly and efficiently."}
