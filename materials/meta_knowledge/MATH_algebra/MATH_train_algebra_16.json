{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating piecewise functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Determine the Correct Piece:** Identify which piece of the function applies based on the input value. For example, if the input is 3, check the condition for \\( x \\ge -2 \\).\n\n2. **Substitute Correctly:** Once you have identified the correct piece of the function, substitute the input value into the corresponding expression and perform the calculation accurately.\n\n3. **Check Boundary Conditions:** Be particularly careful when the input value is exactly at the boundary of the conditions (e.g., \\( x = -2 \\)). Ensure you use the correct piece of the function for such cases.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the substitution and calculation, double-check your arithmetic to avoid simple mistakes.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, if possible, verify your result by checking if the function value makes sense in the context of the problem or by using a different method to confirm the calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating piecewise functions."}
