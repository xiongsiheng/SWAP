{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation involving complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Isolate Variables:** Start by isolating the variable \\( z \\) on one side of the equation. This often involves moving terms involving \\( z \\) to one side and constants to the other.\n\n2. **Use Properties of Complex Numbers:** Remember that \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit where \\( i^2 = -1 \\). Use this property correctly when simplifying expressions.\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms:** When you have terms involving \\( z \\) and constants, combine them appropriately. For example, if you have \\( iz \\) and \\( -iz \\), they cancel each other out.\n\n4. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** Although this equation does not involve radicals, it's still good practice to verify that the solution satisfies the original equation, especially when dealing with complex numbers.\n\n5. **Simplify Fully:** Ensure that your final answer is simplified as much as possible, especially in the context of complex numbers. This includes simplifying any fractions or expressions involving \\( i \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving equations involving complex numbers."}
