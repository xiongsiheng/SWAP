{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** The inverse function \\( f^{-1}(y) \\) gives the value of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(x) = y \\). Ensure you correctly identify the intervals where the function \\( f \\) is defined and solve for \\( x \\) in each interval.\n\n2. **Piecewise Function Analysis:** Since \\( f \\) is a piecewise function, you must consider each piece separately when finding \\( f^{-1} \\). For \\( y = -3 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), and \\( y = 3 \\), determine which part of the function definition applies.\n\n3. **Solving Equations:** For each value of \\( y \\), set up and solve the corresponding equation from the function definition. For example, for \\( y = -3 \\), use \\( 2x - x^2 = -3 \\).\n\n4. **Checking Validity:** Ensure that the solutions for \\( x \\) fall within the correct interval specified by the function definition. For instance, solutions to \\( 2x - x^2 = y \\) must satisfy \\( x > 1 \\).\n\n5. **Summing Results:** After finding \\( f^{-1}(-3) \\), \\( f^{-1}(0) \\), and \\( f^{-1}(3) \\), sum these values. Double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
