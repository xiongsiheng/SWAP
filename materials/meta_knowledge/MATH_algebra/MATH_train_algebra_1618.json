{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the mean of all solutions for this type of polynomial equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Techniques:** Ensure you correctly factor the polynomial. For this equation, you can factor out an \\(x\\) first, leading to \\(x(x^2 + 3x - 10) = 0\\). Then, factor the quadratic \\(x^2 + 3x - 10\\) further if possible.\n\n2. **Solving Polynomials:** Remember that a polynomial equation of degree \\(n\\) has exactly \\(n\\) roots (though some may be complex or repeated). For cubic equations, there are three roots.\n\n3. **Mean Calculation:** The mean of the roots of a polynomial \\(ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \\cdots + k = 0\\) can be found using Vieta's formulas, specifically the sum of the roots (considering their multiplicity) divided by \\(n\\). For a cubic equation, the sum of the roots (real and complex) is \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\).\n\n4. **Complex Roots:** Be aware that complex roots, if present, also contribute to the mean calculation. Ensure you include all roots in your sum.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the mean, it's a good practice to verify your roots by substituting them back into the original equation to confirm they satisfy it.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
