{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying expressions involving square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Product Rule for Square Roots:** Remember that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\times b}\\). This rule allows you to combine square roots under a single radical.\n\n2. **Simplifying Under a Single Radical:** Once you combine the square roots, simplify the expression under the radical by finding the largest perfect square factor and dividing it out. For example, \\(\\sqrt{400} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 100} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Checking for Perfect Squares:** Be aware of common perfect squares (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100) to quickly identify factors that can be simplified directly.\n\n4. **Double-Check Multiplication:** Ensure that you multiply the numbers correctly when combining under a single radical, as this is a common source of error.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After simplifying, double-check your result by calculating the original product of the square roots and comparing it to your simplified result. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your simplification.\n\nThese guidelines will help you minimize errors when working with square roots in multiplication and simplification."}
