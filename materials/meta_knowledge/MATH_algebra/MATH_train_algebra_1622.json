{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving inverse variation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Variation:** Inverse variation means that as one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases proportionally. Mathematically, if \\( y \\) varies inversely with \\( x \\), then \\( y = \frac{k}{x} \\) for some constant \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Finding the Constant \\( k \\):** Use the given information to find the constant of variation \\( k \\). For example, if \\( y = 375 \\) when \\( x = 9 \\), then \\( k = y \\cdot x = 375 \\cdot 9 \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Constant:** Once \\( k \\) is determined, use it to find the new value of \\( y \\) for a different value of \\( x \\). For instance, if \\( x \\) changes to 15 inches, then \\( y = \frac{k}{15} \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for finding \\( k \\) and the subsequent application of the inverse variation formula to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure that the units are consistent throughout the problem, as inconsistent units can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inverse variation."}
