{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** Recall that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the roots \\(r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \frac{c}{a}\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Squares of Roots:** To find the sum of the squares of the roots, use the identity \\(r_1^2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 2r_1r_2\\). This avoids directly calculating the roots.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** When expressing your answer as a fraction, ensure it is in its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and negative numbers, as these can lead to common errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always verify your final answer by re-calculating or using a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
