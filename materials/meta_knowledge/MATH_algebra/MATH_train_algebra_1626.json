{"Knowledge": "To find the constant term in the expansion of a product of polynomials, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Constant Terms:** In each polynomial, identify the constant term. In this case, the constant terms are 5 from the first polynomial and 15 from the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Multiply Constant Terms:** The constant term in the expansion is the product of the constant terms from each polynomial. Multiply these terms together to find the constant term in the final expansion.\n\n3. **Avoid Confusion with Other Terms:** Remember that the constant term in the expansion of a product of polynomials is determined solely by the product of the constant terms of the individual polynomials. Other terms involving powers of \\(x\\) will not contribute to the constant term.\n\n4. **Check for Zero Exponents:** Ensure that you are not mistakenly considering terms that involve \\(x\\) raised to a power other than zero, as these would not be constant terms.\n\nBy focusing on these points, you can accurately determine the constant term in the expansion of polynomial products."}
