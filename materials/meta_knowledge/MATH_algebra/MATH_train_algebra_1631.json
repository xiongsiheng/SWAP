{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identifying Asymptotes:** Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, excluding any points where the numerator is also zero. Identify these points from the graph.\n\n2. **Factorization of Polynomials:** For rational functions like the given one, the denominator can often be factored into simpler terms. Use the roots identified from the asymptotes to help factor the polynomial.\n\n3. **Integer Coefficients:** Since \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are integers, ensure that the factors you derive from the denominator also yield integer coefficients when multiplied out.\n\n4. **Graphical Analysis:** Use the graph to identify key features such as asymptotes and intercepts, which can guide the algebraic manipulation of the equation.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating \\(A + B + C\\), verify that the polynomial matches the observed behavior of the graph, especially around the identified asymptotes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
