{"Knowledge": "To determine the number of points of intersection between the graphs of these equations, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Values:** The graph of \\( y = |2x + 5| \\) represents a V-shape centered around the line \\( 2x + 5 = 0 \\). Similarly, \\( y = -|3x - 2| \\) represents an inverted V-shape centered around the line \\( 3x - 2 = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Symmetry and Intersection:** Absolute value functions are symmetric about their central lines. To find intersections, consider the symmetry and the fact that the graphs must cross at points where the values of \\( y \\) are equal for the same \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Intersection:** Set the equations equal to each other: \\( |2x + 5| = -|3x - 2| \\). Since the left side is always non-negative and the right side is always non-positive, they can only be equal at zero. This implies solving \\( 2x + 5 = 0 \\) and \\( 3x - 2 = 0 \\) to find the points where the graphs might intersect.\n\n4. **Graphical Analysis:** Sketching the graphs can help visualize the points of intersection. The intersection points occur where the lines \\( 2x + 5 = 0 \\) and \\( 3x - 2 = 0 \\) intersect the respective graphs.\n\n5. **Verification:** After identifying potential intersection points, verify them by substituting back into the original equations to confirm they satisfy both.\n\nThese points will aid in accurately determining the number of intersections between the given graphs."}
