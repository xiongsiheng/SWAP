{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of probability problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Events:** Understand the sequence of events clearly. In this case, the coin flips occur in the order Juan, Carlos, Manu, and then the cycle repeats if no one wins.\n\n2. **Geometric Series:** Recognize that the probability of an event happening after a certain number of trials can often be modeled using a geometric series. The probability of Manu winning on his first turn, second turn, and so on, forms a geometric sequence.\n\n3. **Independent Events:** Remember that each coin flip is an independent event. The outcome of one flip does not affect the outcome of another flip.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation:** Calculate the probability of each person winning on their respective turns. For example, the probability of Manu winning on his first turn is the probability that both Juan and Carlos flip tails, followed by Manu flipping heads.\n\n5. **Summing Probabilities:** The total probability of Manu winning is the sum of the probabilities of him winning on his first turn, second turn, and so on. This sum can be found by adding the terms of the geometric series.\n\n6. **Simplifying Fractions:** Ensure that you simplify the final probability fraction correctly, as this step is crucial for accurate results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
