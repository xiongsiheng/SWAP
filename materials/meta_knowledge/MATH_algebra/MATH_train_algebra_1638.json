{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Transformations:** Understand how transformations affect the graph of a function. For example, scaling the input (multiplying \\(x\\) by a constant) or the output (multiplying \\(y\\) by a constant) changes the position of points on the graph.\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting known values into a transformed function, ensure that you simplify the expression correctly. Pay attention to the order of operations and the correct application of the transformation rules.\n\n3. **Coordinate Calculation:** Calculate the new coordinates accurately by applying the transformations to the given point. Double-check your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Sum of Coordinates:** After finding the new point, add the coordinates together carefully. Ensure that you are adding the correct values and that your final sum is accurate.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking if the new point satisfies the transformed equation. This step can help confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
