{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:** Recognize that the problem involves a geometric sequence where the number of paperclips triples each day. This means you can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the initial quantity, \\(r\\) is the common ratio, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Inequality:** To find when Jasmine has more than 100 paperclips, set up an inequality \\(a_n > 100\\) and solve for \\(n\\).\n\n3. **Calculating Exponents:** Be precise when calculating exponents, especially when dealing with large numbers or fractions. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Mapping Days to Numbers:** Understand that the days of the week can be mapped to numbers (e.g., Monday as day 1, Tuesday as day 2, etc.). This helps in determining the specific day when the condition is met.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Results:** After finding the number of days, verify whether the calculated number of paperclips on that day indeed exceeds 100. This step ensures the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
