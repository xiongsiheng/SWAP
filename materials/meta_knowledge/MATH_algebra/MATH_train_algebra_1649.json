{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Equating Decimals and Fractions:** When converting a decimal to a fraction, ensure that the fraction is in its simplest form. This helps in directly comparing it with the given fraction.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Set up the equation by equating the given decimal to the fraction form. This step should be done carefully to avoid any algebraic mistakes.\n\n3. **Solving for the Variable:** When solving for the variable \\( b \\), isolate \\( b \\) on one side of the equation. Use algebraic manipulation techniques like cross-multiplication and simplification.\n\n4. **Checking for Positive Integers:** Ensure that the value of \\( b \\) is a positive integer, as specified in the problem. This involves verifying that the solution meets the constraints given.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the value of \\( b \\) back into the fraction to confirm that it indeed equals the given decimal. This step helps in catching any errors made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
