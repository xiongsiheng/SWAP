{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Squaring Both Sides:** When you square both sides of an equation, you might introduce extraneous solutions. Always check your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.\n\n2. **Simplifying Radicals:** Ensure that you simplify radicals correctly. For example, if you have \\(\\sqrt{a + b}\\), remember that \\(\\sqrt{a + b}\\) is not the same as \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}\\).\n\n3. **Handling Nested Radicals:** Be careful when dealing with nested radicals. Work from the innermost radical outward to avoid mistakes in simplification.\n\n4. **Double-Check Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding or multiplying expressions under square roots, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
