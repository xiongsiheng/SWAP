{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Vertices:** Determine the points where the line intersects the coordinate axes. For the line \\(2x + y = 6\\), set \\(x = 0\\) to find the y-intercept and \\(y = 0\\) to find the x-intercept.\n\n2. **Calculate Intercepts:** The x-intercept is found by setting \\(y = 0\\), which gives \\(2x = 6 \\Rightarrow x = 3\\). The y-intercept is found by setting \\(x = 0\\), which gives \\(y = 6\\).\n\n3. **Form a Right Triangle:** The region formed by the two axes and the line is a right triangle with the x-intercept and y-intercept as the legs.\n\n4. **Area Formula:** Use the formula for the area of a right triangle, which is \\(\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\\). Here, the base and height are the intercepts.\n\n5. **Substitute Values:** Substitute the values of the intercepts into the area formula to calculate the area.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when substituting values into formulas and performing arithmetic operations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
