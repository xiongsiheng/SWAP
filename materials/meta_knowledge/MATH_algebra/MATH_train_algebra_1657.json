{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Relationships:** Inverse relationships mean that as one variable increases, the other decreases proportionally. If two quantities are inversely related, their product is constant.\n\n2. **Calculating Averages:** To find the average of two numbers, add the numbers together and divide by 2. Ensure you correctly sum the scores and divide by the correct number of scores.\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** When setting up equations based on inverse relationships, ensure you correctly represent the product of the variables as a constant.\n\n4. **Solving for Unknowns:** When solving for an unknown in an equation, isolate the variable step by step, ensuring you perform the same operation on both sides of the equation.\n\n5. **Rounding Correctly:** When rounding to the nearest tenth, look at the hundredth place to determine whether to round up or down.\n\n6. **Checking Your Solution:** After finding the solution, verify that it makes sense in the context of the problem by checking if the calculated sleep hours, when combined with the known score, indeed results in the desired average score.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
