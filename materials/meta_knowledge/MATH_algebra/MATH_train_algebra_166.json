{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating the floor function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by \\(\\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor\\), returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\left\\lfloor 2.7 \\right\\rfloor = 2\\) and \\(\\left\\lfloor -2.7 \\right\\rfloor = -3\\).\n\n2. **Handling Negative Numbers:** When dealing with negative numbers, remember that the floor function rounds down to the next integer in the negative direction. For instance, \\(\\left\\lfloor -1.2 \\right\\rfloor = -2\\).\n\n3. **Exact Division:** Ensure you accurately divide the numbers before applying the floor function. For example, \\(-\\frac{5}{3} \\approx -1.6667\\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check your calculation of the division and the application of the floor function to ensure the correct integer is chosen.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can minimize errors when evaluating the floor function."}
