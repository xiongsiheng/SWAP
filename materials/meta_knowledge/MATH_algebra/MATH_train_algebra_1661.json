{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** Ensure you correctly evaluate the function \\( f(x) \\) at the given value. For example, calculate \\( f(4) \\) and \\( f(-4) \\) accurately.\n\n2. **Understanding Composition:** Recognize that \\( g(f(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( f \\) to \\( x \\) and then apply \\( g \\) to the result. This sequence is crucial for correct evaluation.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Parity:** Note if the function \\( f(x) \\) has any symmetry properties (like being an even or odd function). For instance, \\( f(x) = 3x^2 - 7 \\) is even, meaning \\( f(x) = f(-x) \\). This can simplify calculations.\n\n4. **Consistency in Operations:** When substituting values into functions, ensure you consistently apply the same operations. For example, if \\( f(4) = 41 \\), then \\( g(41) = 9 \\); ensure you apply the same logic to \\( f(-4) \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( g(f(-4)) \\), consider checking the consistency with known values or properties of the functions to ensure your solution is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
