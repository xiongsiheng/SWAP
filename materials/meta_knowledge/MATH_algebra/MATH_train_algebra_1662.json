{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Use of Algebraic Identities:** Recognize and apply algebraic identities to simplify the computation. For example, the difference of squares identity, \\((a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2 = 4ab\\), can be used here.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which dictates that you should perform operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n3. **Avoiding Unnecessary Calculations:** Instead of expanding both squares and then subtracting, use the algebraic identity to directly simplify the expression, which can save time and reduce the likelihood of arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After simplifying using the algebraic identity, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when substituting values into the simplified formula.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by performing the calculation step-by-step without using the algebraic identity, and compare the results to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
