{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the ratio of \\( x \\) to \\( y \\) in this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** When dealing with proportions, cross-multiplying can simplify the equation. Remember that if \\(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}\\), then \\(ad = bc\\).\n\n2. **Isolate Variables:** Aim to isolate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) on different sides of the equation. This helps in clearly seeing the relationship between the variables.\n\n3. **Simplify Algebraically:** Simplify the equation step by step, ensuring that each step is logically consistent. Avoid skipping steps that might lead to errors in algebraic manipulation.\n\n4. **Check for Common Factors:** Look for common factors in the numerator and the denominator that can be canceled out to simplify the fraction.\n\n5. **Substitute and Verify:** Once you find the ratio, substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition. This step ensures the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese guidelines will help in accurately determining the ratio of \\( x \\) to \\( y \\) in such problems."}
