{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Geometric Sequence Formula:** Recall that the \\(n\\)-th term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Finding the Common Ratio:** Use the given terms to set up an equation to solve for \\(r\\). For example, if the first term \\(a_1\\) and the 7th term \\(a_7\\) are given, you can write \\(a_7 = a_1 \\cdot r^6\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(r\\):** Ensure you correctly solve for \\(r\\) by isolating it in your equation. This often involves taking the 6th root of both sides of the equation.\n\n4. **Calculating the 5th Term:** Once you have \\(r\\), use it to find the 5th term \\(a_5 = a_1 \\cdot r^4\\). Be careful with your exponent calculations.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Double-check all your calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and roots, as these are common sources of error.\n\n6. **Positive Real Value:** Ensure that your final answer is a positive real number, as specified in the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
