{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function:** Clearly understand the function \\(f(n)\\) and how it assigns points based on the roll of a die. Identify the conditions for each point value (6 points for multiples of both 2 and 3, 2 points for multiples of 2 only, and 0 points for non-multiples of 2).\n\n2. **Checking Multiples:** Accurately determine whether a number is a multiple of 2, 3, or both. This involves simple divisibility checks (a number is a multiple of 2 if it is even, and a multiple of 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3).\n\n3. **Calculating Points:** Apply the function \\(f(n)\\) correctly to each roll to calculate the points for each player. Ensure that you are applying the correct condition for each roll.\n\n4. **Summing Points:** Add up the points for each player accurately. Double-check your addition to ensure there are no arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Calculating the Product:** Once you have the total points for both players, multiply these totals correctly. Verify the multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese steps will help minimize mistakes in calculating the points and the final product."}
