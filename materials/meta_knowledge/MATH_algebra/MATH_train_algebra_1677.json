{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** When solving a system of linear equations, use methods like substitution or elimination to find the values of the variables. Ensure that you correctly isolate variables and substitute accurately.\n\n2. **Checking Solutions:** After solving for the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both equations.\n\n3. **Polynomial Calculation:** When calculating expressions involving polynomials, especially quadratic forms like \\(10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2\\), ensure that you correctly substitute the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and perform the arithmetic accurately.\n\n4. **Identifying Patterns:** Recognize that \\(10x^2 + 12xy + 10y^2\\) can be rewritten as \\((x + y)^2 + 9(x^2 + y^2 + 2xy)\\), which might simplify calculations. Understanding such algebraic identities can help in simplifying the problem.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients during substitution and simplification to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
