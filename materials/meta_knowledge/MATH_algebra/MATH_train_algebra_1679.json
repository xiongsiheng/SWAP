{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\).\n\n2. **Coordinate Addition:** When adding coordinates, ensure you correctly pair the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates. For example, for endpoints \\((2, 3)\\) and \\((-6, 5)\\), add \\(2 + (-6)\\) for the x-coordinate and \\(3 + 5\\) for the y-coordinate.\n\n3. **Division by Two:** After adding the coordinates, divide each sum by 2 to find the midpoint's coordinates. This step is crucial and often overlooked.\n\n4. **Product Calculation:** Once you have the midpoint's coordinates, multiply the x-coordinate by the y-coordinate to find the product. Ensure you perform this multiplication accurately.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your arithmetic, especially when dealing with negative numbers and division, to avoid common mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
