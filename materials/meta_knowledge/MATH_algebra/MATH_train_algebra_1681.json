{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the minimum value of an expression like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** This technique helps in transforming the quadratic expression into a form that reveals the minimum or maximum value. For each variable, complete the square separately.\n\n2. **Understanding Quadratic Forms:** Recognize that expressions of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) or \\(ay^2 + by + c\\) are quadratic and can be minimized or maximized by finding the vertex of the parabola they represent.\n\n3. **Vertex Formula:** For a quadratic function \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), the x-coordinate of the vertex (which gives the minimum value when \\(a > 0\\)) is given by \\(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\). Apply this formula separately to each quadratic term in the expression.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** After completing the square, substitute the simplified forms back into the original expression to find the minimum value. Ensure all steps are logically consistent and correctly applied.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the minimum value, substitute the coordinates back into the original expression to verify that the calculated value is indeed the minimum. This step helps catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors.\n\nThese strategies will help minimize errors and ensure accuracy in finding the minimum value of the given expression."}
