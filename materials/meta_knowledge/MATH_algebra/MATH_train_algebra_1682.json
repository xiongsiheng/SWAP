{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying and rationalizing the denominator of this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Multiplication of Radicals:** When multiplying radicals, you can combine them under a single radical. For example, \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot b}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions with Radicals:** Simplify each fraction individually before multiplying them together. This can often simplify the resulting expression.\n\n3. **Rationalizing the Denominator:** To rationalize the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. For a denominator like \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}\\), the conjugate is \\(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b}\\).\n\n4. **Careful Multiplication:** When multiplying expressions, especially those involving radicals, ensure that you multiply all parts correctly. Missteps in multiplication can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Checking the Final Form:** After rationalizing the denominator, double-check that the expression is in its simplest form by ensuring no further simplifications are possible.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while working with such expressions."}
