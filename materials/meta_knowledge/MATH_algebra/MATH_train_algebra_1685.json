{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving fractional exponents, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractional Exponents:** Remember that a fractional exponent like \\(a^{1/b}\\) means the b-th root of a. For example, \\(64^{1/2}\\) is the square root of 64.\n\n2. **Simplifying Exponents:** When multiplying numbers with different exponents but the same base, add the exponents. However, in this problem, the bases are different, so this rule does not apply directly.\n\n3. **Calculating Individual Terms:** Evaluate each term separately before combining them. For example, calculate \\(64^{1/2}\\), \\(27^{-1/3}\\), and \\(16^{1/4}\\) individually.\n\n4. **Negative Exponents:** A negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of the number. For example, \\(27^{-1/3}\\) means \\(\frac{1}{27^{1/3}}\\).\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that each calculation step is accurate, especially when dealing with roots and reciprocals, as these steps are prone to errors.\n\n6. **Final Multiplication:** After simplifying each term, multiply the results together carefully to get the final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
