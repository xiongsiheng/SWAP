{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Parabola:** The vertex form of a parabola with a vertical axis of symmetry is given by \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex.\n\n2. **Using the Vertex:** Since the vertex is given as \\((5, 3)\\), you can immediately substitute \\(h = 5\\) and \\(k = 3\\) into the vertex form.\n\n3. **Substituting Points:** Use the given point \\((2, 0)\\) to set up an equation by substituting \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 0\\) into the vertex form of the equation.\n\n4. **Solving for \\(a\\):** From the equation obtained by substituting the point, solve for \\(a\\). This will allow you to express the equation in standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\n5. **Converting to Standard Form:** Once you have \\(a\\), expand the vertex form to convert it to the standard form and identify \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n6. **Summing Coefficients:** Finally, add \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to find \\(a + b + c\\).\n\n7. **Verification:** Double-check all calculations and ensure that the equation fits both the vertex and the given point to confirm accuracy.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving the problem."}
