{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding expressions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly by multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside. This means \\(3 \times 8x^2\\), \\(3 \times -2x\\), and \\(3 \times 1\\) should be calculated separately.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately. For instance, \\(3 \times 8x^2 = 24x^2\\), not \\(24x\\) or \\(24x^4\\).\n\n3. **Signs of Terms:** Pay attention to the signs of each term when distributing. Multiplying by a negative number changes the sign of the term.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After distributing, combine like terms if necessary, though in this case, there are no like terms to combine.\n\n5. **Final Check:** Review the expanded form to ensure all terms are correctly multiplied and no terms are missing or duplicated.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy in expanding expressions."}
