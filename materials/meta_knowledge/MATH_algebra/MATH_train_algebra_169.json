{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Piecewise Function:** Determine which part of the piecewise function to use based on the input value. In this case, check if \\( -7 \\) is less than \\( -2 \\) to decide whether to use the first or second case.\n\n2. **Substitute Correctly:** Once the appropriate function piece is identified, substitute the input value correctly into the chosen function.\n\n3. **Perform Arithmetic Carefully:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately. Simple mistakes in addition or subtraction can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Double-Check the Condition:** Verify that the input value satisfies the condition for the chosen piece of the function to avoid applying the wrong formula.\n\n5. **Review the Solution:** After calculating the value, review the steps to ensure that the correct function piece was used and that all calculations were performed correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
