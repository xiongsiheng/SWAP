{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving fractional exponents, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractional Exponents:** Recall that a fractional exponent like \\(a^{\frac{p}{q}}\\) means raising \\(a\\) to the power of \\(p\\) and then taking the \\(q\\)-th root, or vice versa. This is based on the property \\(a^{\frac{p}{q}} = (a^p)^{\frac{1}{q}} = (a^{\frac{1}{q}})^p\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Base Numbers:** Before applying the exponent, simplify the base numbers if possible. For example, recognize that \\(27 = 3^3\\) and \\(32 = 2^5\\).\n\n3. **Using Negative Exponents:** Remember that \\(a^{-b} = \frac{1}{a^b}\\). This property is crucial when dealing with negative fractional exponents.\n\n4. **Exact Calculations:** Perform calculations exactly, especially when dealing with roots and powers, to avoid rounding errors. Use exact forms such as \\(\frac{1}{3}\\) instead of approximating.\n\n5. **Combining Results:** After evaluating each term separately, combine them using appropriate arithmetic operations. Ensure that the final answer is expressed as a common fraction.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in evaluating expressions with fractional exponents."}
