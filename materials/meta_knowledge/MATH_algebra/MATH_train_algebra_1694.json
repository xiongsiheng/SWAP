{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Identify the variables and set up a system of equations based on the given conditions. In this case, let \\( p \\) be the weight of the puppy, \\( c_1 \\) be the weight of the smaller cat, and \\( c_2 \\) be the weight of the larger cat.\n\n2. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that each equation accurately reflects the relationships described in the problem. For example, the first equation should represent the total weight of the puppy and the two cats.\n\n3. **Elimination and Substitution:** Use algebraic techniques such as elimination and substitution to solve the system of equations. Be meticulous in your algebraic manipulations to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Double-Check Solutions:** After finding the values of the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy all conditions.\n\n5. **Logical Reasoning:** Sometimes, logical reasoning can help simplify the problem. For instance, understanding the relationships between the weights can lead to insights that might simplify the algebraic process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
