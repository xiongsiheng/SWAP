{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Definitions:** Ensure you fully understand the piecewise definition of the function \\( f(x) \\). Identify clearly under which conditions each part of the function is applied.\n\n2. **Multiple Conditions:** Be meticulous when determining whether a number is a multiple of 3, 7, both, or neither. This will directly affect which part of the function is used.\n\n3. **Function Nesting:** When dealing with nested functions, track the sequence of function applications carefully. Start with the initial value and apply the function repeatedly, noting each step.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for patterns in the sequence of function values as you apply \\( f \\) multiple times. Recognizing a repeating pattern can help identify the smallest \\( a \\) such that \\( f^a(x) = f(x) \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining a potential value for \\( a \\), verify by calculating \\( f^a(x) \\) and ensuring it matches \\( f(x) \\). This step will confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
