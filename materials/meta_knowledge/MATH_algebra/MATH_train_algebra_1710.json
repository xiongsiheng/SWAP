{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating floor functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor 3.2 \\rfloor\\) equals 3 because 3 is the largest integer that is less than or equal to 3.2.\n\n2. **Handling Decimals:** When dealing with decimal numbers, focus on the integer part of the number. For instance, in \\(\\lfloor 3.2 \\rfloor\\), the integer part is 3, and since 3.2 is greater than 3 but less than 4, the floor value is 3.\n\n3. **Consistency in Notation:** Ensure that you use the correct notation for the floor function. The floor function is represented by brackets with the bottom part missing (like \\(\\lfloor \\rfloor\\)), not parentheses or other brackets.\n\n4. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious not to confuse the floor function with the ceiling function or rounding. The floor function always rounds down to the nearest integer, unlike rounding which can round up or down depending on the decimal value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating floor functions."}
