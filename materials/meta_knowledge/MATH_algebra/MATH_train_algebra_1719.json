{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rearranging Terms:** Start by rearranging the equation to isolate terms involving \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) on one side. This often involves moving all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero.\n\n2. **Factoring:** Look for common factors or patterns that suggest a factorization method. For instance, if you can rewrite the equation in a form that allows for factoring, this can simplify the problem.\n\n3. **Substitution Techniques:** Consider substituting variables to simplify the equation. For example, if you can express \\(m\\) or \\(n\\) in terms of the other variable, this might lead to a simpler equation to solve.\n\n4. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers, test possible integer values systematically. This might involve checking small values first and using patterns to guide larger value checks.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting the values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation. This step is crucial to catch any algebraic or arithmetic errors made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
