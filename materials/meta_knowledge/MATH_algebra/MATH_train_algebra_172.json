{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the number of distinct x-intercepts of a polynomial function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Ensure that the polynomial is fully factored. This helps in identifying all potential x-intercepts.\n\n2. **Solving for Zero:** Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\). Each distinct solution represents an x-intercept.\n\n3. **Checking for Multiplicity:** Be aware of the multiplicity of roots. If a factor appears more than once (e.g., \\((x-a)^2\\)), it still counts as one distinct x-intercept.\n\n4. **Quadratic Factors:** For quadratic factors like \\( x^2 + 5x + 6 \\), use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the roots, if they exist.\n\n5. **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualize or sketch the graph to confirm the number of intercepts, especially when dealing with higher-degree polynomials.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the number of distinct x-intercepts."}
