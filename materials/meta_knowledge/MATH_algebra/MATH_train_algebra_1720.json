{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding polynomial expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly, ensuring each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Signs and Coefficients:** Pay close attention to the signs and coefficients of each term during multiplication. A common error is forgetting to apply the negative sign correctly.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, identify and combine like terms. This step is crucial to simplify the expression and ensure all terms are accounted for.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expanded expression, especially when dealing with multiple operations.\n\n5. **Double-Check Work:** After completing the expansion, double-check your work by reviewing each step to catch any arithmetic or sign errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding polynomial expressions."}
