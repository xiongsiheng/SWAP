{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Product of Roots:** For a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the product of the roots can be directly found using the formula \\(c/a\\). This is a quick way to find the product without needing to solve for the individual roots.\n\n2. **Expanding and Simplifying:** When expanding the given equation \\((x+2)(x-3) = 14\\), ensure that you correctly distribute and combine like terms to form a standard quadratic equation.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Quadratic Equation:** After expanding, set the equation to zero by moving all terms to one side, forming a standard quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** If you choose to find the individual roots using the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), be meticulous with the arithmetic to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with signs and fractions, as these are common sources of error.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
