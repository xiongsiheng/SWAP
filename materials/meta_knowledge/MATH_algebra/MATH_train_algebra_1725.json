{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator and simplifying expressions involving radicals, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Conjugate Multiplication:** When rationalizing a denominator with a binomial involving radicals, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(a + b\\sqrt{c}\\) is \\(a - b\\sqrt{c}\\), and vice versa.\n\n2. **Simplifying Products of Radicals:** When multiplying radicals, use the property \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\). Ensure that the product under the radical is simplified to its simplest form.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After multiplying by the conjugate, combine like terms in the numerator and the denominator. This includes combining any coefficients of the same radical.\n\n4. **Reducing Fractions:** Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n5. **Checking the Form:** Ensure that the final answer is in the required form, with all radicals in simplest form and the fraction in lowest terms. Verify that \\(B < D\\) as specified in the problem.\n\n6. **Summing Constants:** After obtaining the final form of the fraction, sum the constants \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\) to find the required value.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and correctness in solving the problem."}
