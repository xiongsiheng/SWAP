{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the minimum value of a quadratic function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** The minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Once you find the x-coordinate of the vertex, substitute it back into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value.\n\n3. **Coefficient Signs:** The sign of the coefficient \\( a \\) in \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) determines whether the parabola opens upwards (minimum) or downwards (maximum). If \\( a > 0 \\), the parabola has a minimum; if \\( a < 0 \\), it has a maximum.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that calculations involving fractions and square roots are performed accurately to avoid errors in determining the vertex.\n\n5. **Graphical Check:** Optionally, sketching a quick graph of the quadratic function can help visualize the vertex and confirm the calculated minimum value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the minimum value of a quadratic function."}
