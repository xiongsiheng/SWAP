{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the First and Last Terms:** Clearly identify the first term (\\(a_1\\)) and the last term (\\(a_n\\)) of the sequence.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms:** Calculate the number of terms (\\(n\\)) in the sequence using the formula \\(n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1\\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n3. **Use the Sum Formula:** Apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)\\), ensuring that you correctly substitute the values for \\(n\\), \\(a_1\\), and \\(a_n\\).\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for the number of terms and the sum to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verify Consistency:** Ensure that the sequence is consistent with the given terms and that the common difference is correctly identified.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the sum of an arithmetic sequence."}
