{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation involving absolute values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Case Analysis:** Break the problem into cases based on the value of \\( x \\). For \\( x \\geq 0 \\), \\( |x| = x \\), and for \\( x < 0 \\), \\( |x| = -x \\). Solve the equation separately for each case.\n\n2. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving each case, verify that the solutions satisfy the original equation, as some solutions might not hold under the absolute value condition.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and their absolute values, as these can lead to common mistakes.\n\n4. **Comparison of Solutions:** Once you have solutions from both cases, compare them to determine which has the smallest value.\n\n5. **Graphical Understanding:** Optionally, understanding the graphical representation of the equation can help visualize the solutions and their relative sizes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems involving absolute values."}
