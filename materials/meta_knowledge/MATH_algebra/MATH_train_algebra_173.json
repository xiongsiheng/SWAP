{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Relationships:** Recognize that the given equations describe a system where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are related through both multiplication and addition. This suggests a possible quadratic relationship.\n\n2. **Quadratic Roots:** Recall that for two numbers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) to satisfy both \\( mn = 4 \\) and \\( m + n = 5 \\), they must be the roots of the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - (m+n)x + mn = 0 \\). Here, the equation becomes \\( x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratics:** Solve the quadratic equation using methods such as factoring or the quadratic formula. For \\( x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0 \\), factoring gives \\( (x - 4)(x - 1) = 0 \\), so \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are 4 and 1.\n\n4. **Absolute Value Calculation:** Once you have identified \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), calculate \\( |m - n| \\) directly. Since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are 4 and 1 (or vice versa), \\( |m - n| = |4 - 1| = 3 \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify by substituting \\( m = 4 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\) (or vice versa) back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy both \\( mn = 4 \\) and \\( m + n = 5 \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
