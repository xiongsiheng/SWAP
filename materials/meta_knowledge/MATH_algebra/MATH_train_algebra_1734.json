{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to compose functions. For example, if \\( f(x) = -\\frac{1}{x} \\), then \\( f(f(x)) = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{x}} = x \\). This pattern is crucial for solving the problem efficiently.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:** Recognize patterns in the function application. Since \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), applying \\( f \\) twice returns the original value. This symmetry can simplify the computation of multiple compositions.\n\n3. **Careful Calculation:** Perform calculations carefully, especially when dealing with fractions and negative signs. Errors often occur in these areas.\n\n4. **Verification:** After calculating, verify the result by checking if the function properties (like \\( f(f(x)) = x \\)) hold True for the final value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
