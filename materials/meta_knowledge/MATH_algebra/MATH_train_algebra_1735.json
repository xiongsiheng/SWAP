{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given equation \\( h = -16t^2 - 24t + 160 \\) represents a quadratic equation where \\( h \\) is the height of the ball at time \\( t \\). The equation is in the standard form \\( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Setting the Height to Zero:** To find when the ball hits the ground, set \\( h \\) to 0 and solve for \\( t \\). This means solving the equation \\( -16t^2 - 24t + 160 = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** Apply the quadratic formula \\( t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( a = -16 \\), \\( b = -24 \\), and \\( c = 160 \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) in the equation.\n\n4. **Calculating the Discriminant:** Compute the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) accurately to ensure the correct calculation of \\( t \\).\n\n5. **Selecting the Appropriate Root:** Since the ball is thrown downward, choose the positive root of the quadratic equation, as time \\( t \\) cannot be negative.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify all arithmetic operations, especially when calculating square roots and dividing, to avoid computational errors.\n\n7. **Final Verification:** Substitute the calculated time \\( t \\) back into the original equation to confirm that the height \\( h \\) is indeed 0 at that time.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
