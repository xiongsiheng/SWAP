{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the 5th term of an arithmetic sequence, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequence:** An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is known as the common difference.\n\n2. **Formula for the nth Term:** The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Calculating the Common Difference:** The common difference \\(d\\) can be calculated by subtracting the first term from the second term, or more generally, \\(d = a_{n+1} - a_n\\). In this case, since the first and last terms are given, \\(d\\) can be found using \\(d = \\frac{a_{20} - a_1}{19}\\).\n\n4. **Substituting Values:** Once you have the common difference, substitute \\(a_1\\), \\(d\\), and \\(n = 5\\) into the formula for the nth term to find the 5th term.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are done carefully, especially when dealing with fractions or large numbers, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by manually calculating the first few terms of the sequence to see if the 5th term matches your calculated value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the 5th term in an arithmetic sequence."}
