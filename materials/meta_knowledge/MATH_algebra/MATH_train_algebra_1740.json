{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Proportional Relationships:** Recognize that the number of paperclips a box can hold is directly proportional to the volume of the box. This means you can set up a proportion to solve for the unknown number of paperclips.\n\n2. **Setting Up Proportions:** When setting up a proportion, ensure that the units are consistent and that you are comparing the same quantities on both sides of the equation (e.g., volume to volume and number of paperclips to number of paperclips).\n\n3. **Cross-Multiplication:** Use cross-multiplication correctly to solve the proportion. This involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and setting the products equal to each other.\n\n4. **Simplifying Equations:** After cross-multiplication, simplify the resulting equation to find the unknown value. Be careful with arithmetic operations to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Checking Reasonableness:** After finding the answer, check if it makes sense in the context of the problem. For example, if the volume of the box is three times larger, the number of paperclips should also be approximately three times larger.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
