{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identifying Coefficients:** Ensure you correctly identify all the coefficients in the polynomial. For the given polynomial \\(4(x^4 + 3x^2 + 1)\\), the coefficients are 4, 0 (for \\(x^3\\)), 12 (for \\(3x^2\\)), 0 (for \\(x\\)), and 4 (for the constant term).\n\n2. **Calculating Squares:** Accurately calculate the squares of each coefficient. Remember that squaring a number involves multiplying it by itself.\n\n3. **Summing Values:** Add the squared values together carefully, ensuring no addition errors occur. Double-check the addition to confirm the sum is correct.\n\n4. **Constant Multiplication:** Note that multiplying the entire polynomial by a constant (like 4 in this case) affects all coefficients uniformly. Multiply each term's coefficient by this constant before squaring.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your calculations by performing the operations step-by-step again or using a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
