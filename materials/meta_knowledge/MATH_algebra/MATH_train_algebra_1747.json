{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of logarithmic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Form:** Recognize that \\(\\log_{b}a = c\\) means \\(b^c = a\\). This conversion is crucial for solving logarithmic equations.\n\n2. **Exponentiation:** When converting from logarithmic form to exponential form, ensure that the base of the logarithm becomes the base of the exponent.\n\n3. **Solving for the Variable:** After converting to exponential form, solve for the variable directly. In this case, \\(12^2 = 3x\\) should be solved for \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Checking the Solution:** Always verify the solution by substituting it back into the original logarithmic equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n\n5. **Handling Multiplication:** Be careful when dealing with the coefficient in front of the variable inside the logarithm (e.g., \\(3x\\)). Ensure that you correctly isolate and solve for \\(x\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving logarithmic equations."}
