{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have real roots, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be non-negative. In this case, \\(a = 8\\), \\(b = 15\\), and \\(c\\) is the variable. Therefore, \\(15^2 - 4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot c \\geq 0\\) must hold.\n\n2. **Solving for \\(c\\):** From the discriminant condition, solve for \\(c\\) to find the range of \\(c\\) that satisfies the inequality.\n\n3. **Integer Values:** Identify all positive integer values of \\(c\\) within the range found.\n\n4. **Product Calculation:** Calculate the product of these integer values. Ensure you multiply correctly and check your calculations for any arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify by substituting each integer value of \\(c\\) back into the original quadratic equation to confirm it has real roots.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
