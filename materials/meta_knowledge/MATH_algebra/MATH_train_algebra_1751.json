{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the x-intercept of a line, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Intercepts:** The x-intercept of a line is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-coordinate is always 0.\n\n2. **Setting y to 0:** To find the x-intercept, set y = 0 in the equation of the line and solve for x.\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** When solving for x, ensure you perform the arithmetic correctly. This involves isolating x by performing the necessary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n\n4. **Expressing Coordinates:** If the x-coordinate is a fraction, ensure it is in its simplest form. This means the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the x-intercept, you can verify your answer by substituting the x-coordinate back into the equation and ensuring that the equation holds True when y = 0.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in finding the x-intercept of a line."}
