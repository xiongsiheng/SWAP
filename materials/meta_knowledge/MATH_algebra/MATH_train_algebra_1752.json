{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Remember the midpoint formula for a segment connecting points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\).\n\n2. **Intersection of Lines:** When a line intersects another line or segment, the coordinates of the intersection point must satisfy the equation of both the line and the segment.\n\n3. **Substitution:** Substitute the coordinates of the intersection point into the equation of the line to find the value of \\(b\\). Ensure you substitute both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates correctly.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when calculating the midpoint and substituting values into equations, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by checking if the calculated midpoint indeed lies on both the line \\(x + y = b\\) and the line segment from \\((2, 5)\\) to \\((4, 9)\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
