{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Common Denominator:** When dealing with fractions in equations, find a common denominator to combine them. In this case, you can combine the fractions on the left-hand side by finding a common denominator for \\(j\\) and \\(k\\).\n\n2. **Integer Solutions:** Since \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) are positive integers, ensure that any solutions you find are indeed integers. This constraint can help you narrow down possible values.\n\n3. **Symmetric Property:** Notice that the equation is symmetric in \\(j\\) and \\(k\\). This means if \\((j, k)\\) is a solution, then \\((k, j)\\) is also a solution. This symmetry can simplify the search for solutions.\n\n4. **Checking Values:** Test small integer values for \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) to find possible pairs. This methodical approach helps in identifying all valid combinations.\n\n5. **Summing Solutions:** Once you have identified all possible values for \\(k\\), sum them up to get the final answer. Ensure that you include all valid solutions in your summation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
