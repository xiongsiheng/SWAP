{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Defined Operation:** Make sure you correctly interpret the operation defined by the symbol (in this case, $\\#$). For $A \\# B = A^2 + B^2$, it means you need to square both $A$ and $B$ and then add the results.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Substitute the given values into the defined operation to form an equation. Here, substitute $A$ and $5$ into $A \\# B$ to get $A^2 + 5^2 = 169$.\n\n3. **Solving for the Variable:** Isolate the variable $A$ by performing algebraic operations. In this case, subtract $5^2$ from both sides of the equation to solve for $A^2$.\n\n4. **Taking the Square Root:** When finding the value of $A$, remember to take the positive square root since the problem specifies the positive value of $A$.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always check your solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when solving problems involving defined operations."}
