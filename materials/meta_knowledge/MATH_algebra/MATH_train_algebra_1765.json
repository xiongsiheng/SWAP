{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Properties:** Recall the properties of exponents, specifically that \\(a^{m+n} = a^m \\cdot a^n\\). This property will be crucial in solving the problem.\n\n2. **Solving for the Base Exponent:** First, solve for \\(x\\) in the given equation \\(5^x = 100\\). This might involve taking the logarithm of both sides or recognizing a pattern that simplifies the equation.\n\n3. **Applying the Exponent Property:** Once you have the value of \\(x\\), use the exponent property to find \\(5^{x+2}\\). This involves multiplying \\(5^x\\) by \\(5^2\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations involving exponents are correct, as errors in exponentiation can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by substituting the value of \\(x\\) back into the original equation and checking if \\(5^{x+2}\\) matches the expected result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
