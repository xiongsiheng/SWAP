{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cube Root Estimation:** Estimate the values of \\(\\sqrt[3]{10}\\) and \\(\\sqrt[3]{200}\\) accurately. For example, \\(\\sqrt[3]{10} \\approx 2.15\\) and \\(\\sqrt[3]{200} \\approx 5.85\\).\n\n2. **Integer Range Identification:** Identify the range of whole numbers between these estimates. In this case, the whole numbers between 2.15 and 5.85 are 3, 4, and 5.\n\n3. **Counting Whole Numbers:** Simply count the whole numbers within the identified range. Here, there are three whole numbers (3, 4, and 5).\n\n4. **Avoiding Off-by-One Errors:** Ensure you do not miss any numbers or include numbers outside the range by carefully considering the endpoints.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the range to ensure accuracy, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
