{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Properties of Midpoints:** The midpoint of a line segment between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\). This property is crucial when forming new polygons from the midpoints of the sides of another polygon.\n\n2. **Sum of Coordinates:** The sum of the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon remains invariant under the transformation of forming new polygons from the midpoints of its sides. This is because the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates (or \\(y\\)-coordinates) of the midpoints of the sides of a polygon is equal to the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates (or \\(y\\)-coordinates) of the original vertices.\n\n3. **Geometric Transformations:** Understand that forming a new polygon from the midpoints of the sides of an existing polygon is a type of affine transformation that preserves the centroid (average of the coordinates) of the original polygon.\n\n4. **Verification:** Always verify your final answer by ensuring it aligns with the known properties of geometric transformations and coordinate sums.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
