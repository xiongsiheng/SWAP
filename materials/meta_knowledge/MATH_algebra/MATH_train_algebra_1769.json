{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Difference of Squares:** Recognize that the expression \\(\frac{235^2 - 221^2}{14}\\) involves the difference of two squares, which can be factored as \\((235 + 221)(235 - 221)\\). This simplification can make the calculation easier.\n\n2. **Simplification Steps:** After factoring, simplify each part of the expression separately before dividing by 14. This helps in avoiding errors during the division step.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform arithmetic operations accurately, especially when adding and subtracting large numbers. Use a calculator or double-check your calculations manually to avoid mistakes.\n\n4. **Final Verification:** After obtaining the final answer, it can be beneficial to verify the calculation by performing the steps again or using a different method to confirm the result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
