{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognize Algebraic Identities:** Be aware of common algebraic identities, such as the square of a binomial. In this case, recognize that \\(361 + 2(19)(6) + 36\\) resembles the expansion of \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n2. **Check for Simplifications:** Before performing calculations, look for ways to simplify the expression. Here, \\(361\\) is \\(19^2\\) and \\(36\\) is \\(6^2\\), which suggests the expression might simplify directly.\n\n3. **Perform Calculations Carefully:** When performing arithmetic operations, especially multiplication and addition, do so carefully to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Verify the Simplification:** After simplifying, verify that the simplification was correct by ensuring the original expression matches the simplified form.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have your final answer, double-check that it matches the original expression to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors in solving such problems."}
