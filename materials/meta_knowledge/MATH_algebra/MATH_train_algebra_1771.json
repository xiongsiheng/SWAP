{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection points of two parabolas, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Set Equations Equal:** To find where the parabolas intersect, set the equations equal to each other: \\(2x^2 - 7x + 1 = 8x^2 + 5x + 1\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the Equation:** Combine like terms to simplify the resulting equation. Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\n3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the x-coordinates of the intersection points. Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Find Corresponding y-Coordinates:** Substitute each x-coordinate back into either original equation to find the corresponding y-coordinate.\n\n5. **Order Points by x-Coordinate:** List the intersection points in order of increasing x-coordinate, as specified in the problem.\n\n6. **Check for Errors:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations, especially when simplifying and solving the quadratic equation. Ensure that the points you list are indeed solutions by verifying they satisfy both original equations.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in finding the intersection points of the parabolas."}
