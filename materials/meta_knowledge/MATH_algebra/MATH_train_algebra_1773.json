{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Series:** Recognize that the given series is a geometric series. A geometric series is of the form \\(a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \\ldots + ar^n\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Sum of a Geometric Series:** The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula \\(S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Identifying Terms:** In the given series, identify the first term \\(a\\) and the common ratio \\(r\\). Here, \\(a = \frac{2}{3}\\) and \\(r = \frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n4. **Calculating Powers:** Be meticulous when calculating powers of fractions, especially when dealing with large exponents. Use a calculator if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Simplifying Fractions:** After applying the formula, simplify the resulting fraction carefully to ensure the final answer is in its simplest form.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by manually adding a few terms of the series to check if the pattern holds.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
