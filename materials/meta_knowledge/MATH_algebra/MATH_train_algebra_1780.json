{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rewriting a radical expression as an integer, consider the following:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:** Use prime factorization to break down the numbers inside the radical into their simplest prime factors.\n\n2. **Simplifying Radicals:** Understand how to simplify radicals by using the property that \\(\\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a\\). This applies to cube roots as well, where \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^3} = a\\).\n\n3. **Exponent Rules:** Apply exponent rules to combine and simplify the exponents inside the radical. Specifically, remember that \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\) and \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Result:** After simplifying the expression inside the radical, calculate the result to ensure it is an integer.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify all calculations, especially those involving exponents and multiplications, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively simplify the radical expression and ensure the result is an integer without common mistakes."}
