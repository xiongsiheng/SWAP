{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Equations:** Recognize that the equations involve exponential terms. Understanding the properties of exponents, such as \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\(a^0 = 1\\), is crucial.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Treat the problem as a system of equations. Look for ways to manipulate the equations to isolate one variable, typically by substitution or elimination.\n\n3. **Simplifying Exponents:** When dealing with exponents, simplify expressions step by step. For example, \\(2^{x+2}\\) can be rewritten as \\(4 \\cdot 2^x\\) using the property of exponents.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding a potential solution, substitute it back into both original equations to verify that it satisfies both conditions. This step helps catch any algebraic errors.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the coefficients and bases in the equations. Misreading or misapplying these can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
