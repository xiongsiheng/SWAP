{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Remember the algebraic identity \\((x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\\). This identity is crucial for expressing \\(x^2 + y^2\\) in terms of \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Use the given values of \\((x + y)^2\\) and \\(xy\\) to substitute into the identity. This will allow you to isolate \\(x^2 + y^2\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with squares and products. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding the value of \\(x^2 + y^2\\), consider verifying the solution by checking if the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy the original equations also satisfy the derived value of \\(x^2 + y^2\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
