{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. The expression \\(|3x + 5|\\) is not positive only when it equals zero.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find when the absolute value is zero, set the expression inside the absolute value equal to zero: \\(3x + 5 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\):** Solve the equation \\(3x + 5 = 0\\) by isolating \\(x\\). This involves subtracting 5 from both sides and then dividing by 3.\n\n4. **Expressing the Answer as a Fraction:** Ensure that your final answer is expressed as a common fraction, as specified in the problem.\n\n5. **Double-Checking the Solution:** Verify that your solution makes the original expression zero, which confirms that the absolute value is indeed not positive.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
