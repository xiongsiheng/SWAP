{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rewriting a quadratic expression in the form \\(c(j + p)^2 + q\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** This method involves transforming the quadratic expression \\(aj^2 + bj + c\\) into the form \\(a(j + d)^2 + e\\). Identify the coefficient of \\(j^2\\), factor it out if necessary, and then complete the square for the remaining quadratic and linear terms.\n\n2. **Identifying Constants:** After rewriting the expression, clearly identify the constants \\(c\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\). Ensure that \\(c\\) is the coefficient of the squared term, \\(p\\) is the constant inside the parentheses, and \\(q\\) is the remaining constant term.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when calculating the values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Errors in these calculations can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After determining \\(c\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\), simplify the expression \\(\frac{q}{p}\\) carefully to avoid division errors or incorrect simplifications.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, expand the rewritten form \\(c(j + p)^2 + q\\) back to check if it matches the original quadratic expression, ensuring the transformation was done correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
