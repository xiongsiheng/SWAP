{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rates:** Ensure you understand the concept of rate, which is the distance traveled per unit of time. In this case, Jana's rate is 1 mile per 24 minutes.\n\n2. **Proportional Reasoning:** Recognize that the distance traveled is directly proportional to the time spent traveling. Use this proportional relationship to find the distance for a different time period.\n\n3. **Unit Conversion:** Be clear about the units involved. Here, the rate is given in miles per minute, so ensure your calculations respect this unit.\n\n4. **Decimal Precision:** When expressing the answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth, ensure you round correctly. Use standard rounding rules (round up if the next digit is 5 or more, round down if it's less than 5).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the division or multiplication to find the distance, double-check your calculations to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
