{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio:** For a geometric sequence, the common ratio \\( r \\) is found by dividing any term by the previous term. Ensure you calculate this ratio accurately.\n\n2. **General Formula for Geometric Sequences:** The \\( n \\)-th term of a geometric sequence can be found using the formula \\( a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)} \\), where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Fraction Handling:** When dealing with fractions, especially in multiplication or exponentiation, ensure you simplify correctly and maintain the fraction form as required.\n\n4. **Exponent Calculation:** Be precise when calculating exponents, especially when they involve fractions or decimals. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by calculating a few intermediate terms to ensure the pattern holds up to the eighth term.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
