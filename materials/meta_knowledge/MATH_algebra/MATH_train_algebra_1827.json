{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** When dealing with a system of equations, ensure that you manipulate both equations consistently. Changes in one equation should be reflected in the other if necessary.\n\n2. **Integer Solutions:** Since the problem specifies positive integers, focus on methods that are likely to yield integer results. Avoid complex fractions or non-integer operations that might complicate finding integer solutions.\n\n3. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods carefully. Substitute variables accurately and check for algebraic errors during elimination steps.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, verify them by substituting back into both original equations to ensure they satisfy both conditions.\n\n5. **Logical Steps:** Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one. Avoid making assumptions that are not supported by the equations themselves.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
