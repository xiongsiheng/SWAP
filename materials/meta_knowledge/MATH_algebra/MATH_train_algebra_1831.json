{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating infinite geometric series, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the First Term (a):** The first term of the series is the first number in the sequence. In this case, it is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Common Ratio (r):** The common ratio is found by dividing any term by the preceding term. For this series, calculate \\(\\frac{-\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{3}{2}} = -\\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n3. **Use the Sum Formula:** The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by \\(S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\), provided that \\(|r| < 1\\). Ensure that the common ratio's absolute value is less than 1 to apply this formula.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Be meticulous with your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and negative numbers, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Check the Convergence:** Before applying the sum formula, confirm that the series converges by ensuring \\(|r| < 1\\). If \\(|r| \\geq 1\\), the series does not have a finite sum.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating infinite geometric series."}
