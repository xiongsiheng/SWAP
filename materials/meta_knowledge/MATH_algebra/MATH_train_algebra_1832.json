{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Recall the midpoint formula, which states that the midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) is given by \\( M\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) \\).\n\n2. **Solving for Coordinates:** Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for the coordinates of point \\( B \\). For example, if \\( M(2, 5) \\) and \\( A(3, 1) \\), then \\( 2 = \frac{3 + x_2}{2} \\) and \\( 5 = \frac{1 + y_2}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Solve the equations for \\( x_2 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) by isolating these variables. This involves basic algebraic operations such as multiplication and subtraction.\n\n4. **Product Calculation:** Once you have the coordinates of point \\( B \\), calculate the product of these coordinates. Ensure that you multiply the correct values and check your arithmetic.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking that \\( M(2, 5) \\) is indeed the midpoint of \\( A(3, 1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) using the midpoint formula.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving the problem."}
