{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) for an equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -63\\), and \\(c = k\\).\n\n2. **Prime Number Properties:** Remember that a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. For the roots to be prime, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be a perfect square, and the roots must be integers.\n\n3. **Discriminant Analysis:** Calculate the discriminant \\(63^2 - 4k\\) and ensure it is a perfect square. This is crucial because the roots being prime numbers implies the discriminant must be such that the square root yields an integer.\n\n4. **Possible Prime Pairs:** Consider pairs of prime numbers that add up to 63. This is because the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(-b/a\\), which in this case is 63.\n\n5. **Verification:** After identifying possible pairs of prime numbers, verify that their product equals \\(k\\). This step ensures that the values of \\(k\\) are correct and that the roots indeed form a valid quadratic equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
