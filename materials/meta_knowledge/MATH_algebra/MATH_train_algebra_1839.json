{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation \\(\\diamondsuit\\). In this case, \\(x \\diamondsuit y = 3x + 5y\\). This means you need to substitute the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into the given formula.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Accurately substitute the given values into the operation. For example, if you need to find \\(2 \\diamondsuit 7\\), substitute \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 7\\) into the formula.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform the arithmetic operations carefully. Ensure that you multiply and add correctly, as errors in basic arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the operations, double-check your calculations to ensure there are no mistakes in addition or multiplication.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
