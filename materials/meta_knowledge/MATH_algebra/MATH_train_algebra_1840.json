{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding Both Sides:** Ensure that you expand both sides of the equation correctly. Missteps in expansion can lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Equating Coefficients:** When you have polynomials set equal to each other, the coefficients of corresponding powers of \\(x\\) must be equal. This method is crucial for finding the value of \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Handling Zero Coefficients:** Be aware of terms that might cancel out or become zero, especially when dealing with polynomial equations. This can simplify the equation but requires careful attention.\n\n4. **Checking for Non-Zero Conditions:** Since \\(k \neq 0\\), ensure that your solution does not inadvertently assume \\(k = 0\\), which would invalidate the solution.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding a potential value for \\(k\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step is essential to confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
