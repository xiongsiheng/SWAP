{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which dictates that multiplication should be performed before addition. In this case, multiply 26 by 33 and 67 by 26 first.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Notice that both terms in the expression share a common factor (26). Use the distributive property to simplify the calculation: \\(26 \times 33 + 67 \times 26 = 26 \times (33 + 67)\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that multiplications and additions are performed accurately. Double-check each step to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After applying the distributive property, simplify the expression inside the parentheses before multiplying.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After obtaining the final answer, it can be helpful to verify the calculation using a different method or a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while performing such computations."}
