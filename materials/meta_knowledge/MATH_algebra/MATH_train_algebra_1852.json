{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding expressions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly, which means distributing each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial. For example, \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication of Terms:** Ensure that you multiply coefficients and combine exponents correctly. For example, \\((a \\cdot b^n) = ab^n\\) and \\((b^n \\cdot b^m) = b^{n+m}\\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), ensuring that multiplication is performed before addition.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After expanding, simplify the expression by combining like terms. This involves adding or subtracting terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n5. **Double-Check Work:** After completing the expansion, double-check each step to ensure accuracy, especially in the multiplication and combination of terms.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding such expressions."}
