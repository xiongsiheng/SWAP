{"Knowledge": "To determine the range of \\( f(x) - x \\) from the given graph, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Identify Key Points:** Locate the coordinates of the points on the graph where \\( f(x) \\) is explicitly given or can be inferred. These points will help in understanding the behavior of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Differences:** For each identified point, calculate \\( f(x) - x \\). This will give you specific values to consider within the interval.\n\n3. **Analyze Trends:** Observe any trends or patterns in the values of \\( f(x) - x \\) as \\( x \\) varies across the interval. This can help in predicting the minimum and maximum values of \\( f(x) - x \\).\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** Express the range of \\( f(x) - x \\) using interval notation, ensuring that you include all possible values calculated and any inferred from the trends.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the inclusion of all relevant points to ensure accuracy in determining the range.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically determine the range of \\( f(x) - x \\) and express it correctly in interval notation."}
