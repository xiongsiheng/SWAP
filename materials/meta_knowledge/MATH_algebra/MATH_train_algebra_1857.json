{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of multiplication, consider the following:\n\n1. **Use of Algebraic Identities:** Recognize that \\(98 \times 102\\) can be seen as \\((100 - 2)(100 + 2)\\), which is an application of the algebraic identity \\((a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2\\). This simplifies the calculation to \\(100^2 - 2^2\\).\n\n2. **Mental Math Techniques:** Practice mental math techniques to quickly square numbers and subtract. For instance, \\(100^2 = 10000\\) and \\(2^2 = 4\\), so the calculation becomes \\(10000 - 4 = 9996\\).\n\n3. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when using mental math or shortcuts, to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Avoid Common Errors:** Be cautious of common errors such as misapplying the algebraic identity or making mistakes in the subtraction step.\n\n5. **Use of Calculator:** If permitted, use a calculator to verify your result, but ensure you input the numbers correctly to avoid calculator-related errors.\n\nThese strategies will help minimize errors in performing such calculations."}
