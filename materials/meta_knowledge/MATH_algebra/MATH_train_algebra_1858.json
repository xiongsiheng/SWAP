{"Knowledge": "To determine the number of vertical asymptotes for a rational function like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Denominator's Zeros:** Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the rational function is zero and the numerator is non-zero. Find the roots of the denominator by solving the equation \\(x^2 + 6x - 7 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Factorization:** Factor the quadratic expression in the denominator to find its roots. This helps in identifying the exact points where the function's behavior changes.\n\n3. **Check for Common Factors:** Ensure that the numerator and denominator do not share common factors after factorization. If they do, those points are removable discontinuities, not vertical asymptotes.\n\n4. **Count the Distinct Roots:** Each distinct root of the denominator that is not a root of the numerator corresponds to a vertical asymptote. Count these to determine the total number of vertical asymptotes.\n\n5. **Graphical Understanding:** Optionally, sketching a graph or using a graphing tool can visually confirm the presence and number of vertical asymptotes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the number of vertical asymptotes for a given rational function."}
