{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Exponential Identities:** Remember that \\(4^y = (2^2)^y = 2^{2y}\\). This identity can simplify the comparison of the two sides of the equation.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When the bases are the same, you can set the exponents equal to each other. For example, if \\(2^a = 2^b\\), then \\(a = b\\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** The equation \\(x^2 - 3x - 2 = 2(x - 4)\\) is quadratic. Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots, where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots can be directly found using the relationship \\(-b/a\\).\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify that the solutions satisfy the original equation, as errors in algebraic manipulation can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
