{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the inverse of a function and evaluating it, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** The inverse function \\( f^{-1}(y) \\) gives the value of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(x) = y \\). Therefore, to find \\( f^{-1}(-31/96) \\), you need to solve the equation \\( f(x) = -31/96 \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Set up the equation \\( \frac{x^5 - 1}{3} = -31/96 \\). This involves substituting \\( y = -31/96 \\) into the function definition.\n\n3. **Solving the Equation:** Isolate \\( x \\) by first clearing the fraction. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get \\( x^5 - 1 = -31/32 \\). Then, solve for \\( x^5 \\) and finally take the fifth root of both sides.\n\n4. **Checking the Solution:** After finding \\( x \\), verify that \\( f(x) = -31/96 \\) to ensure the correctness of your solution. This step is crucial as it confirms that the value found is indeed the preimage of \\( -31/96 \\) under \\( f \\).\n\n5. **Careful with Roots:** Be cautious when taking roots, especially odd roots, as they can be directly evaluated without worrying about the sign (positive or negative), unlike even roots which require consideration of both positive and negative values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
