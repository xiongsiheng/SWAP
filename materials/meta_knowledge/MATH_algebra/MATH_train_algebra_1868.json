{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rationalization:** Rationalizing the denominator involves eliminating square roots from the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by an appropriate expression.\n\n2. **Choosing the Correct Conjugate:** For expressions like \\(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{b}}\\), multiply by \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{b}}{\\sqrt{b}}\\). Ensure that the expression you choose to multiply by does not change the value of the original fraction.\n\n3. **Simplifying Square Roots:** Simplify square roots by factoring out perfect squares. For example, \\(\\sqrt{125}\\) can be simplified as \\(\\sqrt{25 \times 5} = 5\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n4. **Performing Multiplication:** Carefully multiply the numerator and the denominator, ensuring that you distribute correctly and simplify any resulting expressions.\n\n5. **Checking for Further Simplification:** After rationalizing, check if the resulting fraction can be simplified further by reducing common factors in the numerator and the denominator.\n\n6. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail during calculations to avoid common arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure the accuracy of your final answer."}
