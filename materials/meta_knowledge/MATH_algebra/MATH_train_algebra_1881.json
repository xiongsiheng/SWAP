{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving absolute values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, which is always non-negative. For example, \\(|x| = x\\) if \\(x \\geq 0\\) and \\(|x| = -x\\) if \\(x < 0\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Step-by-Step:** Work through the expression step-by-step, starting from the innermost absolute value and moving outward. This helps in avoiding confusion and mistakes.\n\n3. **Handling Nested Absolute Values:** When dealing with nested absolute values, simplify each layer individually. For example, if you have \\(|\\, |a| - b \\,|\\), first determine the value of \\(|a|\\) and then proceed with the outer absolute value.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to each calculation, especially when dealing with negative numbers and subtraction, as these can lead to common errors.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After simplifying the expression, verify that the final result matches the expected pattern or logic, ensuring that no steps were missed or miscalculated.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving nested absolute values."}
