{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. For example, \\(| -4.2 | = 4.2\\).\n\n2. **Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor = -5\\).\n\n3. **Combining Results:** After computing the absolute value and the floor function, add the results carefully, ensuring that you handle both positive and negative values correctly.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Perform the operations in the correct order: first compute the absolute values, then apply the floor function, and finally add the results.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify each step of your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with negative numbers and the floor function.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
