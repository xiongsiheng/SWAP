{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding of Roots in Polynomials:** For a quadratic polynomial \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) to have exactly one real root, its discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by \\(b^2 - 4ac\\).\n\n2. **Using the Given Condition:** Utilize the given condition \\(b = c + 1\\) to express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(c\\). This will help in substituting \\(b\\) into the discriminant formula.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(c\\):** Set the discriminant equal to zero and solve the resulting equation for \\(c\\). This step involves careful algebraic manipulation to isolate \\(c\\).\n\n4. **Product of Solutions:** If the equation for \\(c\\) results in multiple solutions, find the product of all possible values of \\(c\\). This typically involves understanding the nature of the solutions (whether they are real or complex) and correctly multiplying them.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the final product to ensure accuracy. Substituting the values back into the original conditions can help verify the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
