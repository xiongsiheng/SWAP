{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving inverse proportionality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Recall that if two quantities are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. Mathematically, this is expressed as \\(\\alpha \\cdot \\beta = k\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Finding the Constant:** Use the given values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) to determine the constant \\(k\\). For example, if \\(\\alpha = 4\\) when \\(\\beta = 9\\), then \\(k = 4 \\cdot 9 = 36\\).\n\n3. **Using the Constant:** Once you have the constant \\(k\\), use it to find the unknown value. If \\(\\beta\\) changes to a new value, say \\(\\beta = -72\\), then \\(\\alpha\\) can be found by solving \\(\\alpha \\cdot (-72) = 36\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be careful with arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers, as these can lead to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the new value of \\(\\alpha\\), it can be helpful to verify by checking that the product of the new \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) equals the constant \\(k\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inverse proportionality."}
