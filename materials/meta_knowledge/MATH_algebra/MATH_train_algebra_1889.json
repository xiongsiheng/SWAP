{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Fractions:** When dealing with fractions, simplify the numerator and the denominator separately before performing the division. This can often lead to significant simplifications.\n\n2. **Recognizing Patterns:** Look for patterns or special forms in the expression. For example, expressions of the form \\(\\frac{a^2 - a}{a}\\) can be simplified by factoring out \\(a\\) from the numerator.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with large numbers or exponents. Simple arithmetic mistakes can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** After simplifying, substitute the simplified form back into the original expression to verify that the simplification was correct. This step ensures that no mistakes were made during the simplification process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
