{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value equation $|x-a|=b$ has two solutions: $x = a + b$ and $x = a - b$.\n\n2. **Checking Both Solutions:** Always consider both possible solutions derived from the absolute value equation to ensure you find all valid answers.\n\n3. **Comparing Solutions:** When asked to find the largest or smallest value of $x$, compare the two solutions directly to determine which one meets the criteria.\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Common errors include forgetting to consider both solutions or incorrectly calculating the values from the absolute value equation. Double-check your calculations.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute both solutions back into the original equation to confirm they satisfy the condition, ensuring accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
