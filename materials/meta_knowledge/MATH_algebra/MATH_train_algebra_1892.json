{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Define Variables:** Clearly define the dimensions of the rectangle using variables, such as \\( l \\) for length and \\( w \\) for width.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:** Use the given conditions to set up equations. For example, the area of the rectangle is \\( l \times w \\), and the perimeter is \\( 2l + 2w \\). Equate these two expressions.\n\n3. **Integer Solutions:** Since the dimensions are integers, ensure that any solutions you find are integer pairs.\n\n4. **Check for Non-Square Rectangles:** Verify that the dimensions are not equal, as the problem specifies a non-square rectangle.\n\n5. **Simplify and Solve:** Simplify the equations to find the possible dimensions and then calculate the perimeter. Double-check your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute your found dimensions back into both the area and perimeter equations to ensure they match, confirming the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
