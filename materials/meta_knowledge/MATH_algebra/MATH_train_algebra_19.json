{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving complex numbers, particularly with the imaginary unit \\(i\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Powers of \\(i\\):** Remember that \\(i\\) is the square root of -1, and thus \\(i^2 = -1\\). The powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four terms: \\(i^1 = i\\), \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), \\(i^4 = 1\\), and then the cycle repeats. This pattern helps in simplifying higher powers of \\(i\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Powers:** To simplify \\(i^n\\), divide \\(n\\) by 4 and use the remainder to determine the equivalent power within the cycle (0 to 3). For example, \\(i^6\\) simplifies to \\(i^2\\) because 6 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2.\n\n3. **Negative Powers:** For negative exponents, use the property \\(i^{-n} = \frac{1}{i^n}\\). Simplify \\(i^n\\) as usual and then take the reciprocal.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Operations:** Be cautious with arithmetic operations, especially when combining terms. Ensure that you are adding or subtracting like terms correctly.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating, verify your results by checking if they fit the pattern of powers of \\(i\\). This step helps catch any computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating expressions involving the imaginary unit \\(i\\)."}
