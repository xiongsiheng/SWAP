{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Formulate equations based on the given information. For example, if the flat fee for the first night is \\( F \\) and the fixed amount for each additional night is \\( N \\), you can set up equations like \\( F + 2N = 155 \\) for George and \\( F + 5N = 290 \\) for Noah.\n\n2. **Solving Systems of Equations:** Use algebraic methods such as substitution or elimination to solve the system of equations. Ensure that you correctly isolate variables and perform algebraic operations accurately.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem. For instance, ensure that the flat fee and the nightly rate are positive and reasonable values.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Once you find the values for \\( F \\) and \\( N \\), substitute them back into the original equations to confirm that they satisfy both conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
