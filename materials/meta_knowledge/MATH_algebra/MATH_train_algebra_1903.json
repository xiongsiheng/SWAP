{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of logarithmic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Properties:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as \\(\\log_b (a^c) = c \\log_b a\\) and \\(b^{\\log_b a} = a\\). These properties are crucial for simplifying and solving logarithmic equations.\n\n2. **Solving for the Argument:** When given a logarithmic equation like \\(\\log_9 (x-2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), convert it to its exponential form: \\(9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x - 2\\). This helps in isolating the variable.\n\n3. **Handling Fractional Exponents:** Be comfortable with fractional exponents. For example, \\(9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\\). This is essential for correctly interpreting and solving the equation.\n\n4. **Substitution and Conversion:** After finding the value of \\(x\\), use it to find \\(\\log_{625} x\\). Remember that \\(\\log_{625} x\\) can be rewritten using the change of base formula, \\(\\log_{625} x = \\frac{\\log x}{\\log 625}\\), if needed.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to your calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and logarithms, as these can be prone to errors. Verify your final answer by substituting it back into the original logarithmic equation to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
