{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Clearly define variables for unknown quantities (e.g., let \\( b \\) be the number of boys and \\( g \\) be the number of girls).\n\n2. **Using All Given Information:** Ensure that all pieces of information provided in the problem are used in your solution. For example, use the total number of members and the attendance details.\n\n3. **Checking Logical Consistency:** Ensure that your solution makes logical sense within the context of the problem. For instance, the number of boys and girls should be non-negative integers and should sum up to the total number of members.\n\n4. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions or percentages, as these can lead to common errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding a solution, verify it by substituting the values back into the problem to ensure they satisfy all conditions given.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
