{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the tenth term in a geometric sequence, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio:** Determine the common ratio (r) by dividing any term by the previous term. In this case, the common ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Use the Formula for the nth Term:** The nth term of a geometric sequence can be found using the formula \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(r\\) is the common ratio, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Correct Exponentiation:** Ensure that you correctly calculate \\(r^{(n-1)}\\) for the desired term. In this problem, you need to calculate \\((\\frac{1}{3})^{9}\\).\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for the common ratio and exponentiation to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Substitute and Simplify:** Substitute the values of \\(a_1\\), \\(r\\), and \\(n\\) into the formula and simplify the expression to find the tenth term.\n\nBy following these steps, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the tenth term in the geometric sequence."}
