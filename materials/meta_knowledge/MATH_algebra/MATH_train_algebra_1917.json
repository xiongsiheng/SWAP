{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly translate the problem's conditions into mathematical equations. For this problem, you should have one equation representing the sum of the numbers and another representing the equality condition after transformations.\n\n2. **Consistency in Variables:** When setting up your equations, make sure each variable represents the same quantity throughout the problem. For example, if \\(a\\) is one of the original numbers, it should consistently represent that in all equations.\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When solving for multiple variables, use appropriate methods like substitution or elimination to ensure accuracy. Check each step to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding a solution, substitute the values back into the original conditions to verify that they satisfy all parts of the problem.\n\n5. **Understanding Transformations:** Clearly understand how each transformation (addition, subtraction, multiplication) affects the variables to correctly set up and solve the equality condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
