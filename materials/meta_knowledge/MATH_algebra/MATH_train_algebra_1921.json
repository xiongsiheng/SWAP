{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly translate the problem into mathematical equations. For this problem, you should set up two equations based on the given conditions: one for the sum and one for the difference.\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When solving pairs of linear equations, use appropriate methods such as substitution or elimination to find the values of the variables. Be careful with signs and operations to avoid calculation errors.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions.\n\n4. **Identifying the Smaller Number:** Once you have the values of both numbers, compare them to correctly identify which one is smaller.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the details of the problem, such as whether you are asked for the smaller or larger number, to ensure your final answer is accurate.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
