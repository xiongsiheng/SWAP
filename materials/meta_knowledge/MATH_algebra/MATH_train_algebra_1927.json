{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. It is always non-negative.\n\n2. **Using the Difference of Squares:** The difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\), can simplify calculations. Apply this formula to find the difference between the squares of two numbers.\n\n3. **Calculating Squares:** Ensure accurate calculation of squares. For example, \\(101^2\\) and \\(99^2\\) should be calculated correctly to avoid errors.\n\n4. **Performing Subtraction:** Pay close attention to subtraction, especially when dealing with large numbers, to avoid common mistakes like borrowing or carrying.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when using shortcuts like the difference of squares formula, to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
