{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by \\(\\lfloor r \\rfloor\\), represents the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(r\\). Understanding this definition is crucial for correctly interpreting the equation.\n\n2. **Decimal and Integer Parts:** Recognize that \\(r\\) can be expressed as the sum of its integer part (\\(\\lfloor r \\rfloor\\)) and its fractional part (\\(r - \\lfloor r \\rfloor\\)). This decomposition helps in setting up and solving the equation.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** When \\(\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 12.2\\), it implies that \\(r\\) must be a number between 12 and 13 (since \\(\\lfloor r \\rfloor\\) is 12 and \\(r\\) is slightly more than 12).\n\n4. **Solving for the Fractional Part:** Isolate the fractional part of \\(r\\) and solve for it. Ensure that the fractional part is positive and less than 1, as it represents the decimal part of a number.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition, as this step will catch any errors in the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
