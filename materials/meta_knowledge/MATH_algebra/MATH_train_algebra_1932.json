{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Exponent Rules:** Understand and apply the rules of exponents correctly. For example, \\(a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:** Use prime factorization to express numbers in their simplest form. For instance, \\(16 = 2^4\\) and \\(8 = 2^3\\).\n\n3. **Combining Exponents:** When multiplying numbers with the same base, add the exponents. For example, \\(16^3 \\times 8^3 = (2^4)^3 \\times (2^3)^3\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify the expression by combining the exponents according to the rules. For example, \\((2^4)^3 \\times (2^3)^3 = 2^{4 \\times 3} \\times 2^{3 \\times 3} = 2^{12} \\times 2^9 = 2^{12+9} = 2^{21}\\).\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the final expression matches the form given in the problem (\\(2^K\\)) and identify the value of \\(K\\) correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
