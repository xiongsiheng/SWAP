{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the first term of an infinite geometric series, consider the following:\n\n1. **Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series:** The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series with first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) (where \\( |r| < 1 \\)) is given by the formula \\( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \\).\n\n2. **Isolating the First Term:** To find the first term \\( a \\), rearrange the sum formula to solve for \\( a \\): \\( a = S(1 - r) \\).\n\n3. **Absolute Value of the Ratio:** Ensure that the common ratio \\( r \\) satisfies \\( |r| < 1 \\), which is necessary for the series to converge.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions, to avoid common errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the first term, verify your result by substituting \\( a \\) and \\( r \\) back into the sum formula to ensure it equals the given sum of the series.\n\nThese guidelines will help you accurately determine the first term of the series."}
