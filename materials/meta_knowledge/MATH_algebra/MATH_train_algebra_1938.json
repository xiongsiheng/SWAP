{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Prime Numbers:** Recall that a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. This means that for \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 = p \\), \\( p \\) must be a number that cannot be factored into smaller integers other than 1 and \\( p \\).\n\n2. **Quadratic Equations:** When dealing with quadratic equations like \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 \\), use the quadratic formula \\( n = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -35 \\), and \\( c = 306 \\). This helps in finding the roots of the equation.\n\n3. **Factoring Techniques:** Try to factor the quadratic expression \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 \\) to see if it can be expressed in a form that makes it easier to identify when it equals a prime number.\n\n4. **Checking Integral Solutions:** Ensure that the values of \\( n \\) you find are positive integers, as the problem specifies positive integral values of \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Product Calculation:** Once you identify the valid values of \\( n \\), calculate their product carefully. Use properties of multiplication, such as commutativity and associativity, to avoid calculation errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the identified values of \\( n \\) back into the original equation to verify that \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 \\) indeed equals a prime number. This step helps confirm the correctness of your solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
