{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating with the new operation $\\nabla$, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation $\\nabla$. It involves adding the two numbers and then dividing by 1 plus their product.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply the order of operations correctly. First, calculate the product $ab$, then add $a$ and $b$, and finally divide the sum by $1 + ab$.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure precise arithmetic calculations, especially when multiplying and adding numbers, as these steps directly affect the final result.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the expression step by step to avoid errors. For instance, simplify the numerator and the denominator separately before performing the division.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify the calculation by substituting the result back into the definition of $\\nabla$ to ensure it matches the given example format.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while performing calculations with the new operation $\\nabla$."}
