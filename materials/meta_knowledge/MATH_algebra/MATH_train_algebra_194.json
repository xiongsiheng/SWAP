{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the custom operation (in this case, \\(\\clubsuit\\)). Ensure you correctly apply the formula given.\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting values into the formula, do so accurately. For example, replace \\(B\\) with 4 in the given operation.\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** After setting up the equation (3A + 2B + 5 = 58), solve for \\(A\\) by isolating it. This involves basic algebraic manipulations like subtracting constants and dividing by coefficients.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic steps to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, once you find the value of \\(A\\), substitute it back into the original operation to verify that the result is indeed 58.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving problems involving custom operations."}
