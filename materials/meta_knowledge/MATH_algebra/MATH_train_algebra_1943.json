{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing squares of numbers mentally, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Use the Difference of Squares:** If the number is close to a multiple of 10, you can use the difference of squares formula. For example, \\(95^2\\) can be thought of as \\((100 - 5)^2\\), which simplifies using \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n2. **Break Down the Number:** Split the number into more manageable parts. For \\(95^2\\), you can think of it as \\(90 \times 100 + 25\\), which simplifies the mental calculation.\n\n3. **Memorize Common Squares:** Knowing squares of common numbers (like 10, 20, 30, etc.) can help in quick calculations by providing reference points.\n\n4. **Check the Result:** After calculating, quickly verify the result by estimating. For example, \\(95^2\\) should be close to \\(100 \times 90\\), which is 9000, helping to catch gross errors.\n\nThese strategies can enhance accuracy and speed when computing squares mentally."}
