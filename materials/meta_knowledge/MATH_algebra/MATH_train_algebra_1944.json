{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Clearing Fractions:** To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by \\( x \\) to clear the denominator. This step simplifies the equation and avoids potential errors related to fractions.\n\n2. **Rearranging Terms:** After clearing the fraction, rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation. This helps in applying the quadratic formula or factoring methods directly.\n\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring is not straightforward, use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the roots. Ensure that you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving the quadratic equation, check each solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the original condition. This step helps in identifying and discarding any extraneous solutions.\n\n5. **Sum of Roots:** For quadratic equations of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots can be directly found using the relationship \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\). This shortcut can be useful for quickly verifying the sum of solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
