{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Linear Equations:** Understand that a system of linear equations can be solved using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. Choose the method that minimizes the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\n2. **Elimination Method:** When using the elimination method, ensure that you multiply or divide the equations correctly to align coefficients for elimination. Missteps in this process can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Substitution Method:** If using substitution, isolate one variable correctly and substitute it into the other equation without errors. This step is crucial as it directly affects the solution.\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:** Before proceeding with calculations, check if the system is consistent (has a solution) or inconsistent (no solution). This can be done by comparing the slopes and intercepts of the lines represented by the equations.\n\n5. **Ratio Calculation:** When finding the ratio \\(\frac{a}{b}\\), ensure that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are calculated accurately from the solution of the system. Dividing incorrect values will yield an incorrect ratio.\n\n6. **Nonzero Constraints:** Be mindful of the constraint that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are nonzero. This implies that the solution must not include zero values for either variable, which can affect the validity of the ratio \\(\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
