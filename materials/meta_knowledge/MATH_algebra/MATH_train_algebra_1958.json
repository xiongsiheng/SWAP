{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognize Algebraic Patterns:** Notice that the expression \\(23^2 + 2(23)(2) + 2^2\\) resembles the expansion of a binomial squared, specifically \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). In this case, \\(a = 23\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Binomial Theorem:** Use the binomial theorem to quickly recognize and simplify the expression. For \\((a + b)^2\\), the result is \\((23 + 2)^2 = 25^2\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Result:** Once you identify the simplified form, calculate \\(25^2\\) directly to get the final answer. This step ensures accuracy in the final computation.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with squares and multiplications, to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
