{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula for finding the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\): \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). This formula is essential for finding the roots.\n\n2. **Discriminant:** The term under the square root in the quadratic formula, \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), is known as the discriminant. It determines the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).\n\n3. **Roots Difference:** The difference between the roots can be found using the formula \\(|\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}|\\). This formula helps in expressing the difference in the required form.\n\n4. **Simplifying Radicals:** Ensure that you simplify radicals correctly. For example, when simplifying \\(\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\\), make sure it is in its simplest form, not divisible by the square of any prime number.\n\n5. **Integer Properties:** When dealing with integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), ensure that \\(m\\) is not divisible by the square of any prime number, and \\(n\\) is an integer. This helps in correctly identifying \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Always verify your final values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) by substituting them back into the context of the problem to ensure they satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
