{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rates and Proportions:** Ensure you correctly interpret the relationship between the speeds of the car and the train. The car travels at \\(\frac{3}{4}\\) the speed of the train.\n\n2. **Time Conversion:** Be aware that the problem involves converting minutes to hours since speed is given in miles per hour. 20 minutes is \\(\frac{1}{3}\\) of an hour.\n\n3. **Calculating Distance:** Use the formula \\( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \\). Make sure to calculate the speed of the car correctly by multiplying the train's speed by \\(\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Multiplication:** Pay close attention to the multiplication steps, especially when dealing with fractions and decimals, to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After calculating the distance, double-check your arithmetic to ensure the accuracy of your answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
