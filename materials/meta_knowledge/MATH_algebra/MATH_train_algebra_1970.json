{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand the conditions given in the problem. In this case, the condition is that one coordinate is exactly twice the other, which can be expressed as either \\( y = 2x \\) or \\( x = 2y \\).\n\n2. **Graphical Representation:** When dealing with coordinate geometry problems, it's often helpful to sketch the situation. Plot the lines \\( y = 2x \\) and \\( x = 2y \\) on the coordinate plane to visualize how they divide the plane.\n\n3. **Intersection Points:** Determine the intersection points of the lines with the axes and each other. This helps in understanding the regions formed by the lines.\n\n4. **Counting Regions:** After plotting the lines, count the number of distinct regions they create. Be systematic in your counting to avoid missing or double-counting regions.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your solution by ensuring that each region satisfies the condition given in the problem (i.e., one coordinate is exactly twice the other).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
