{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Unit Conversion:** Ensure that all monetary values are in the same unit. In this case, convert all prices to dollars or cents to maintain consistency.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Formulate equations based on the given information. For example, if \\( x \\) represents the number of 30-cent items, \\( y \\) represents the number of 2-dollar items, and \\( z \\) represents the number of 3-dollar items, you can set up equations for the total number of items and the total cost.\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Use algebraic methods to solve the system of equations. Be careful with steps like substitution or elimination to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Verify your solution by substituting the values back into the equations to ensure they satisfy both the total number of items and the total cost.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the details of the problem, such as the specific prices and quantities, to ensure accuracy in setting up and solving the equations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
