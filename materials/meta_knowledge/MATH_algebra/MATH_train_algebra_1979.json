{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly when expanding the product of two polynomials. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms carefully. This means adding or subtracting coefficients of terms with the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n3. **Identifying Coefficients:** Identify and sum the coefficients of each term correctly. For example, \\(Ax^3\\) will come from the product of the first term of each polynomial, \\(Bx^2\\) from the appropriate products, and so on.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding or subtracting coefficients, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Final Summation:** Ensure that you sum the coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) accurately to find the value of \\(A + B + C + D\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
