{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Look for common factors in each term of the expression. In this case, \\((x+1)\\) is a common factor.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly to factor out the common factor. Remember, \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\).\n\n3. **Simplify Inside the Parentheses:** After factoring out the common term, simplify the expression inside the parentheses by combining like terms.\n\n4. **Check Your Work:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure that you get the original expression, which helps verify the correctness of your factoring.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients, as errors often occur with minus signs or incorrect coefficients.\n\nThese tips will help you factor expressions accurately and efficiently."}
