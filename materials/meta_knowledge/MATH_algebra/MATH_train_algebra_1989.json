{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving systems of linear equations, consider the following:\n\n1. **Isolate Variables:** Start by isolating one variable in one of the equations. This often involves simple algebraic manipulations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing both sides of the equation by the same term.\n\n2. **Substitution or Elimination:** Use the method of substitution or elimination to solve for one variable and then the other. Substitution involves replacing a variable in one equation with its equivalent from another equation. Elimination involves adding or subtracting the equations to cancel out one of the variables.\n\n3. **Check Your Work:** After finding the values of the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy both equations. This step helps verify the correctness of your solution.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers or when combining terms. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\n5. **Understand the Problem:** Clearly understand what the problem is asking for. In this case, after solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you need to calculate \\(3 - a\\). Ensure you are answering the specific question posed.\n\nThese guidelines will help you minimize errors and ensure accuracy in solving systems of linear equations."}
