{"Knowledge": "To solve this problem effectively, consider the following:\n\n1. **Sum of First n Positive Integers:** The sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is given by the formula \\( S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). This formula is crucial for calculating the points from dropping froods.\n\n2. **Points from Eating Froods:** The points earned from eating \\( n \\) froods is a linear function, \\( P = 10n \\). This is straightforward to calculate.\n\n3. **Inequality Setup:** To find the least number of froods for which dropping them earns more points than eating them, set up the inequality \\( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} > 10n \\). Solving this inequality will give you the required \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** When solving the inequality \\( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} > 10n \\), you will encounter a quadratic inequality. Solve it by first simplifying to standard form \\( n^2 + n > 20n \\), then \\( n^2 - 19n > 0 \\). Factorize and solve for \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Once you find the range of \\( n \\) from the inequality, determine the smallest integer \\( n \\) within that range. This will be your answer.\n\nThese points will help you systematically approach and solve the problem with minimal errors."}
