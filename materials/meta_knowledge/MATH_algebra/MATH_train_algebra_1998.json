{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Square Both Sides:** When you square both sides of an equation to eliminate the square root, remember that this operation can introduce extraneous solutions. Always verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.\n\n2. **Solving Linear Equations:** After squaring both sides, you will typically have a linear equation to solve. Ensure that you correctly isolate the variable (in this case, \\( z \\)) and perform the necessary arithmetic operations accurately.\n\n3. **Fraction Handling:** If the solution involves fractions, ensure that you simplify the fraction correctly and express it in its simplest form. This includes reducing the fraction to its lowest terms and checking for any common factors.\n\n4. **Domain Constraints:** Before solving, consider the domain of the original equation. For square roots, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. This constraint can help you identify if a solution is valid or extraneous.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
