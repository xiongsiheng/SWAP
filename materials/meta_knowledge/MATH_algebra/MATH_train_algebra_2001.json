{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** Understand that the function \\( f(x) \\) is defined to be a constant value (in this case, 2) for all real numbers \\( x \\). This means that regardless of the input, the output will always be the same.\n\n2. **Function Evaluation:** When evaluating \\( f(x + 2) \\), remember that since \\( f(x) \\) is constant, the value of \\( f(x + 2) \\) will be the same as \\( f(x) \\). This is because the function does not change with different inputs.\n\n3. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that your understanding of the function's behavior is consistent with the given definition. Since \\( f(x) = 2 \\) for all \\( x \\), any transformation of \\( x \\) (like \\( x + 2 \\)) should also yield the same constant value.\n\n4. **No Calculation Needed:** Recognize that in this scenario, you do not need to perform any calculations or transformations beyond understanding the constant nature of the function.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
