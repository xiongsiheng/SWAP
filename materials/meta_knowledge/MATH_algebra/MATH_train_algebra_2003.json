{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractions:** Ensure you have a clear understanding of fractions and how to compare them. For example, recognize that \\(\\frac{3}{7} = 0.428571...\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\\).\n\n2. **Inequalities with Fractions:** When dealing with inequalities involving fractions, convert the fractions to decimal form or find a common denominator to accurately determine the range of values.\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:** Identify the integer values within the specified range. For \\(\\frac{M}{56}\\) to be strictly between \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), \\(M\\) must be an integer that satisfies this condition.\n\n4. **Calculating the Average:** To find the average of a set of integers, sum all the integers in the set and then divide by the number of integers in the set. Ensure you include all relevant integers in your sum.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the range and the integers you include in your calculation to ensure no values are missed or incorrectly included. This step is crucial for accuracy in your final average calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
