{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Slope:** The slope of a line, given as \\(m\\), represents the rate of change in \\(y\\) for a unit change in \\(x\\). In this case, a slope of \\(-2\\) means that for every unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) decreases by 2 units.\n\n2. **Using the Slope-Intercept Form:** The equation of a line can be written in the slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept. Use this form to find \\(b\\) by substituting the given \\(x\\)-intercept into the equation.\n\n3. **Substitution and Solving:** Substitute the coordinates of the \\(x\\)-intercept \\((5, 0)\\) into the equation \\(y = -2x + b\\) to solve for \\(b\\). This will directly give you the \\(y\\)-intercept.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that you perform the arithmetic accurately, especially when dealing with negative numbers and when solving for \\(b\\).\n\n5. **Expressing the Answer:** The \\(y\\)-intercept is an ordered pair \\((0, b)\\). Make sure to express your final answer in this format.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
