{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Inequalities:** Understand how to solve quadratic inequalities by finding the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation (in this case, \\(z^2 - 40z + 340 = 4\\)). The roots will help determine the intervals where the inequality holds.\n\n2. **Factoring or Using the Quadratic Formula:** Use factoring or the quadratic formula to find the roots of the quadratic equation. For the quadratic formula, remember it is \\(z = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\).\n\n3. **Sign Analysis:** After finding the roots, perform a sign analysis to determine where the quadratic expression is less than or equal to 4. This involves testing values in the intervals defined by the roots.\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** Express your final answer in interval notation, correctly indicating whether the endpoints (roots) are included or excluded based on the inequality sign.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure all calculations, especially those involving the quadratic formula and sign analysis, are done accurately to avoid errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
