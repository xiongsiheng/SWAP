{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value equation $|x-2|=p$ means that $x-2$ can be either $p$ or $-p$. Given the condition $x<2$, we choose the solution that makes $x-2$ negative, which is $x-2=-p$.\n\n2. **Solving for $x$:** From $x-2=-p$, solve for $x$ to get $x=2-p$.\n\n3. **Substituting into the Expression:** To find $x-p$, substitute $x=2-p$ into the expression to get $(2-p)-p$.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Expression:** Simplify the expression $(2-p)-p$ to $2-2p$.\n\n5. **Double-Check Your Work:** Always verify that your steps are logically consistent and that the final expression makes sense given the original conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
