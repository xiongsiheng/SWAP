{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identifying Common Terms:** Notice that both equations share the term \\( (x+y) \\). This can be used to your advantage to find the value of \\( (x+y) \\).\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When dealing with simultaneous equations, look for ways to combine or manipulate the equations to isolate variables. In this case, adding or subtracting the equations might help.\n\n3. **Checking Algebraic Manipulations:** Ensure that all algebraic manipulations are correct, especially when expanding, factoring, or simplifying expressions. For example, ensure that \\( (x+y)^2 \\) is correctly expanded to \\( x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\).\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** Once you find a value for \\( (x+y) \\), substitute it back into the original equations to verify that it satisfies both conditions.\n\n5. **Avoiding Rounding Errors:** If calculations involve decimals, avoid premature rounding which can lead to inaccurate results. Use exact values as long as possible.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
