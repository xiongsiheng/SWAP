{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the sum of the roots of this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding and Simplifying:** Start by expanding the equation to its standard quadratic form. For example, expand \\((x - 5)^2 = 9\\) to \\(x^2 - 10x + 25 = 9\\), then simplify to \\(x^2 - 10x + 16 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** Recall that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\). In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -10\\), so the sum of the roots is \\(-\frac{-10}{1} = 10\\).\n\n3. **Checking by Solving:** Alternatively, solve the equation directly by finding the roots \\(x = 5 \\pm 3\\), which gives \\(x = 8\\) and \\(x = 2\\). The sum of these roots is \\(8 + 2 = 10\\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Be cautious not to confuse the sum of the roots with the product of the roots, which is given by \\(\frac{c}{a}\\) for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Always double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy, as small errors can significantly affect the outcome.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the sum of the roots of quadratic equations."}
