{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when converting repeating decimals to fractions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up the Equation:** Let the repeating decimal be equal to a variable, say \\( x \\). For example, if the repeating decimal is \\( 0.\\overline{4} \\), set \\( x = 0.\\overline{4} \\).\n\n2. **Multiplying by Powers of 10:** Multiply both sides of the equation by 10 (or a higher power of 10, depending on the length of the repeating part) to shift the decimal point to the right. For \\( 0.\\overline{4} \\), multiply by 10 to get \\( 10x = 4.\\overline{4} \\).\n\n3. **Subtracting the Equations:** Subtract the original equation from the new equation to eliminate the repeating part. For \\( 0.\\overline{4} \\), subtract \\( x = 0.\\overline{4} \\) from \\( 10x = 4.\\overline{4} \\) to get \\( 9x = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\):** Solve the resulting equation for \\( x \\) to find the fraction. For \\( 9x = 4 \\), divide both sides by 9 to get \\( x = \frac{4}{9} \\).\n\n5. **Simplifying the Fraction:** Ensure that the fraction is in its simplest form. In this case, \\( \frac{4}{9} \\) is already simplified.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, convert the fraction back to a decimal to verify that it matches the original repeating decimal.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy when converting repeating decimals to fractions."}
