{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simultaneous Equations:** When dealing with two equations like \\(x + y = 4\\) and \\(3xy = 4\\), express one variable in terms of the other using one equation and substitute into the other. This helps in forming a quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Quadratic Formula:** Remember the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) for solving quadratic equations. Identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly to apply the formula.\n\n3. **Simplifying Rational Expressions:** When simplifying expressions of the form \\(\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\\), ensure that the fraction is in its simplest form and that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are positive integers with no common factors other than 1.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Substitute the solutions back into the original equations to verify their correctness. This step is crucial to ensure that the solutions satisfy both original equations.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and operations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, as these can lead to errors if not handled carefully.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
