{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the area of a triangle formed by intersecting lines, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Slope:** Recall that the slope of a line is the rise over the run, which helps in determining the direction and steepness of the line.\n\n2. **Equation of a Line:** Use the point-slope form of the line equation, \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is a point on the line. This helps in finding the equations of the lines given their slopes and a point of intersection.\n\n3. **Intersection Points:** Calculate the x-intercepts (where y = 0) for each line to find points Q and R. This involves setting y to 0 in the line equations and solving for x.\n\n4. **Area of a Triangle:** Use the formula for the area of a triangle, \\( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \\), where the base and height are perpendicular to each other. Ensure that the base and height are correctly identified in relation to the triangle's orientation.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when substituting values into formulas and solving for unknowns, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, sketch the lines and the triangle on a coordinate plane to visually verify the positions of points and the correctness of the area calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the area of the triangle in this problem."}
