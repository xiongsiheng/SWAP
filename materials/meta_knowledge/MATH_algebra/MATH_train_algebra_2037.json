{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Properties:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as \\(\\log_b(a^c) = c \\log_b(a)\\) and \\(\\log_b(b^x) = x\\). These properties are crucial for simplifying and solving logarithmic equations.\n\n2. **Recognizing Exponential Equivalents:** Recognize that \\(16\\) can be written as \\(4^2\\). This equivalence can help in setting up the equation in a more manageable form.\n\n3. **Equating Exponents:** When dealing with equations of the form \\(a^{\\log_b(x)} = c\\), if \\(c\\) can be expressed as \\(a^k\\), then \\(\\log_b(x) = k\\). This simplifies the problem by reducing it to a logarithmic equation.\n\n4. **Solving for the Variable:** Once you have simplified the equation to \\(\\log_b(x) = k\\), convert it back to its exponential form \\(x = b^k\\) to find the value of \\(x\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
