{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Recognize and apply algebraic identities correctly. For example, in this problem, you can use the identity \\(x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)\\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods carefully to solve for variables. Ensure that you substitute correctly and that your steps logically follow one another.\n\n3. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations. Simple calculation errors can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n4. **Consistency of Equations:** Ensure that the equations you derive are consistent with the original problem constraints. This helps in verifying the correctness of your solution path.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Substitute your final values back into the original equations to confirm that they satisfy both conditions. This step is crucial to ensure the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
