{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence Relationship:** Clearly understand the relationship given in the problem. In this case, each term after the first is \\(\frac{1}{3}\\) of the sum of the preceding and following terms. This relationship is crucial for setting up your equations.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given relationship to set up equations for each term in the sequence. For instance, if \\(a_n\\) represents the \\(n\\)-th term, you can express \\(a_{n+1}\\) in terms of \\(a_n\\) and \\(a_{n+2}\\).\n\n3. **Substitution and Elimination:** Once equations are set up, use substitution and elimination methods to solve for the unknown terms. Ensure that you substitute correctly and eliminate variables systematically to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Pay close attention to your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and sums. Errors in basic arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the required term, verify your solution by checking if it satisfies the original conditions of the sequence. This step ensures that your solution is consistent with the problem's requirements.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
