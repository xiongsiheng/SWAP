{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Define Variables Clearly:** Clearly define the three consecutive even integers. For example, let the first integer be \\( x \\), the second be \\( x + 2 \\), and the third be \\( x + 4 \\).\n\n2. **Use Given Information:** Utilize the given information effectively. In this case, use the fact that the sum of the first and third integers is 128 to set up an equation.\n\n3. **Set Up Correct Equations:** Ensure that the equation you set up accurately reflects the problem statement. For instance, if the sum of the first and third integers is 128, then \\( x + (x + 4) = 128 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for the Variable:** Solve the equation carefully, ensuring that you perform each step correctly. This includes combining like terms and isolating the variable.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:** After finding the value of \\( x \\), verify that the three integers are indeed consecutive even integers and that their sum matches the conditions given in the problem.\n\n6. **Check Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
