{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Analyzing Piecewise Functions:** Identify which piece of the function applies based on the given condition for \\( x \\). For example, determine whether \\( x < -2 \\) or \\( x \\ge -2 \\) when solving for \\( f(x) = -5 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Equations:** Solve the equation for each piece of the function separately. For linear equations (like \\( 2x + 7 = -5 \\)), isolate \\( x \\) directly. For quadratic equations (like \\( -x^2 - x + 1 = -5 \\)), rearrange to standard form and solve using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.\n\n3. **Checking Validity of Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions for \\( x \\) fall within the specified range for each piece of the function. Solutions that do not meet the condition should be discarded.\n\n4. **Summing Solutions:** After finding valid solutions for \\( x \\), sum them together. This step requires careful addition, especially if solutions involve fractions or decimals.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Work:** Verify each step, especially the algebraic manipulations and the conditions under which each piece of the function is valid. This helps catch any errors in logic or calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
