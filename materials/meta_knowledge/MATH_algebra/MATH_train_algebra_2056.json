{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Remember the quadratic formula for solving equations of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), which is \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). This will help you find the roots \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\u000barphi\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant:** Ensure that the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) is non-negative for real solutions. In this case, since the equation \\(x^2 = x + 1\\) can be rewritten as \\(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\\), the discriminant is \\(1^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 5\\), which is positive, indicating two distinct real solutions.\n\n3. **Roots Properties:** Use the properties of the roots of a quadratic equation, such as the sum \\(\\Phi + \u000barphi = -\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product \\(\\Phi \u000barphi = \frac{c}{a}\\), to simplify calculations.\n\n4. **Difference of Squares:** When calculating \\((\\Phi - \u000barphi)^2\\), use the identity \\((\\Phi - \u000barphi)^2 = (\\Phi + \u000barphi)^2 - 4\\Phi\u000barphi\\). This simplifies the calculation by using known properties of the roots.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, to ensure accuracy. Substituting the roots back into the original equation can also verify their correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
