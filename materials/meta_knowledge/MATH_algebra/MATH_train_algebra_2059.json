{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithms:** Recall the definition of logarithms: \\(\\log_{10}{x} = y\\) means \\(10^y = x\\). This helps in understanding the magnitude of the logarithm.\n\n2. **Estimation Skills:** Use estimation to quickly determine the approximate value of the logarithm. For example, \\(\\log_{10}{10} = 1\\) and \\(\\log_{10}{100} = 2\\), so \\(\\log_{10}{17}\\) will be between 1 and 2.\n\n3. **Interpolation:** Since 17 is closer to 10 than to 100, \\(\\log_{10}{17}\\) will be closer to 1 than to 2. This helps in narrowing down the range more precisely.\n\n4. **Checking Consecutive Integers:** Identify the consecutive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a < \\log_{10}{17} < b\\). For \\(\\log_{10}{17}\\), \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n\n5. **Summing the Integers:** Once \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are identified, simply add them together to find \\(a + b\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
