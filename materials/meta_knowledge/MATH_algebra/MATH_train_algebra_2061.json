{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly identify the given information (quotient and product of two integers) and what is being asked (the larger integer).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given quotient and product to form two equations. For example, if the integers are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you can write \\(a/b = 5/2\\) and \\(ab = 160\\).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Express one variable in terms of the other using the quotient equation, then substitute into the product equation to solve for the variables.\n\n4. **Checking for Positive Integers:** Ensure that the solutions are positive integers, as specified in the problem.\n\n5. **Identifying the Larger Integer:** Once you have the values of both integers, compare them to determine which is larger.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by verifying that the quotient and product conditions are satisfied with the found integers.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and correctness in solving the problem."}
