{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the equation \\(\\left|A\right| = B\\) implies \\(A = B\\) or \\(A = -B\\). Apply this principle to both sides of the equation.\n\n2. **Solving Rational Equations:** When solving equations involving fractions, ensure that you correctly isolate the variable. Check for any restrictions on \\(x\\) (e.g., \\(x \neq 0\\)) to avoid division by zero.\n\n3. **Handling Multiple Solutions:** Be prepared to solve two separate equations after removing the absolute value. This will give you multiple potential solutions for \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Product:** After finding all possible values of \\(x\\), multiply them together. Ensure that the multiplication is done accurately, especially if the values are fractions.\n\n5. **Expressing as an Improper Fraction:** If your final product is a mixed number, convert it to an improper fraction. This involves multiplying the whole number part by the denominator and then adding the numerator.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify each solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
