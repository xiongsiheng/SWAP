{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations accurately. For this problem, let \\( J \\) represent John's age and \\( D \\) represent his dad's age. The relationships given can be translated into \\( D = J + 24 \\) and \\( J + D = 68 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Use substitution or elimination methods correctly to solve the equations simultaneously. Substitute \\( D \\) from the first equation into the second to solve for \\( J \\).\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic calculations, especially when adding, subtracting, or multiplying numbers, to avoid simple mistakes.\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding a solution, verify it by substituting the values back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy both given statements.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
