{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator and simplifying expressions involving square roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Conjugate Multiplication:** To rationalize the denominator of a fraction with a binomial in the denominator involving a square root, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. For example, if the denominator is \\(1 - \\sqrt{3}\\), the conjugate is \\(1 + \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Products of Conjugates:** Remember that the product of a binomial and its conjugate results in the difference of squares. For example, \\((1 - \\sqrt{3})(1 + \\sqrt{3}) = 1^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1 - 3 = -2\\).\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After multiplying by the conjugate, combine like terms in the numerator. This often involves combining terms with and without square roots.\n\n4. **Simplifying Fractions:** Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor if possible.\n\n5. **Identifying \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\):** Once the expression is in the form \\(A + B\\sqrt{C}\\), identify \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) as integers and calculate their product \\(ABC\\).\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when solving problems involving rationalizing denominators and simplifying expressions with square roots."}
