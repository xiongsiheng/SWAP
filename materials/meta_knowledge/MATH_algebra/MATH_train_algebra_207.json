{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value Graphs:** Recognize that the graph of \\( y = |x| \\) is V-shaped with the vertex at the origin (0,0). The graph of \\( y = |x| - 3 \\) shifts this vertex down by 3 units to (0, -3).\n\n2. **Translations in Graphs:** When a graph is translated horizontally (left or right), changes affect the \\( x \\)-values of the coordinates. For example, translating a graph \\( k \\) units to the left involves replacing \\( x \\) with \\( x + k \\). Translating vertically (up or down) affects the \\( y \\)-values, where replacing \\( y \\) with \\( y - k \\) shifts the graph \\( k \\) units down.\n\n3. **Calculating New Coordinates:** To find the new coordinates after translations, apply the shifts directly to the original coordinates. For instance, if the original vertex is at (0, -3), shifting 2 units to the left changes the \\( x \\)-coordinate to \\( 0 - 2 = -2 \\), and shifting 3 units down changes the \\( y \\)-coordinate to \\( -3 - 3 = -6 \\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Always double-check the calculations for the new coordinates to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with both horizontal and vertical shifts.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
