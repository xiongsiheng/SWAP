{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form:** Rewrite the inequality in standard form, ensuring it is set to zero on one side. For example, convert $2x^2 + 8x \\le -6$ to $2x^2 + 8x + 6 \\le 0$.\n\n2. **Factoring or Quadratic Formula:** Determine the roots of the quadratic equation either by factoring or using the quadratic formula. This helps in understanding where the expression equals zero.\n\n3. **Sign Analysis:** Perform a sign analysis of the quadratic expression. Determine where the expression is positive, negative, or zero by testing values in each interval defined by the roots.\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** Express the solution in interval notation, including the roots if the inequality includes equality (e.g., $\\le$ or $\\ge$).\n\n5. **Graphical Representation:** Optionally, sketch a graph of the quadratic function to visually confirm the intervals where the function is below or at the line y = 0.\n\nThese steps ensure a systematic approach to solving quadratic inequalities and help minimize common errors."}
