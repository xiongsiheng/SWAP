{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding Both Sides:** When expanding both sides of the equation, use the distributive property correctly. For example, \\((a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) and \\((a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd\\).\n\n2. **Equating Polynomials:** Once both sides are expanded, equate the coefficients of corresponding terms on both sides of the equation. This helps in setting up a system of equations.\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** Solve the system of equations carefully, ensuring that you handle each step correctly, especially when dealing with fractions or complex numbers.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the value of \\(w\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation.\n\n5. **Calculating \\(w^2\\):** Ensure that you square the value of \\(w\\) correctly to find \\(w^2\\), and express the final answer as a decimal if required.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
