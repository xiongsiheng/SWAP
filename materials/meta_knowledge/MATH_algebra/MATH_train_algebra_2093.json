{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the common ratio of a geometric sequence, consider the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Common Ratio:** The common ratio in a geometric sequence is the constant factor by which each term is multiplied to get the next term. It is calculated by dividing any term by the preceding term.\n\n2. **Consistency in Calculation:** Always use the same method to calculate the common ratio for each pair of consecutive terms to ensure consistency and accuracy. For example, consistently divide the second term by the first, the third by the second, and so on.\n\n3. **Sign Consideration:** Pay attention to the signs of the terms. The common ratio should maintain the same sign pattern throughout the sequence. If the terms alternate in sign, the common ratio will be negative.\n\n4. **Verification:** After calculating the common ratio, verify it by checking that multiplying each term by this ratio correctly predicts the subsequent term in the sequence.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the common ratio of a geometric sequence."}
