{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Remember to apply the distributive property correctly, which means multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the term outside the parentheses. For example, in $(a + b) \\cdot c$, you should calculate $a \\cdot c + b \\cdot c$.\n\n2. **Multiplication of Terms:** Ensure that you multiply the coefficients and the variables correctly. For instance, $13x \\cdot 2x$ involves multiplying the numbers (13 and 2) and the variables ($x$ and $x$), resulting in $26x^2$.\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms:** After distributing, combine any like terms. In this case, there are no like terms to combine since $26x^2$ and $30x$ are distinct.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when multiplying large numbers or dealing with negative signs, as these can lead to common mistakes.\n\n5. **Final Expression:** Write the final expanded expression clearly, ensuring that all terms are correctly represented and ordered, typically from highest to lowest power of the variable.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in expanding algebraic expressions."}
