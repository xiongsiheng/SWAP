{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving ratios and algebraic expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** When dealing with ratios, cross-multiplying can simplify the equation. Remember that if \\(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}\\), then \\(ad = bc\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Algebraic Expressions:** Always simplify both sides of the equation before proceeding. Combine like terms and factor where possible to make the equation more manageable.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\):** When solving for \\(x\\), ensure that you isolate \\(x\\) correctly. Check for any common factors that can be divided out to avoid division by zero errors.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving the equation, verify that each solution does not make any denominator zero, as this would result in an undefined expression.\n\n5. **Calculating the Product:** When finding the product of all real solutions, ensure that you multiply the solutions correctly. This step is straightforward but critical to get the correct final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
