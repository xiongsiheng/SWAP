{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of arithmetic problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this case, multiplication comes before addition.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Recognize that you can use the distributive property to simplify calculations. For example, \\(12 \times 24 + 36 \times 12\\) can be rewritten as \\(12 \times (24 + 36)\\).\n\n3. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each operation, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with larger numbers.\n\n4. **Use of Calculator:** If using a calculator, ensure that you input the numbers and operations correctly to avoid simple input errors.\n\n5. **Mental Math Checks:** Use mental math or estimation to quickly check if your final answer seems reasonable, which can help catch glaring errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving arithmetic problems."}
