{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Analysis:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) determines the nature of the roots. Specifically, \\(\\Delta > 0\\) gives two distinct real roots, \\(\\Delta = 0\\) gives one real root (a repeated root), and \\(\\Delta < 0\\) gives no real roots.\n\n2. **Symmetry in Expressions:** Be aware of the symmetry in the expression \\(b + \frac{1}{b}\\). This can simplify calculations and help in identifying conditions for unique solutions.\n\n3. **Setting Conditions for Unique Solutions:** To have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. Set up the equation for the discriminant and solve for \\(c\\) under the condition that \\(b\\) is positive.\n\n4. **Handling Rational Expressions:** When dealing with expressions like \\(b + \frac{1}{b}\\), ensure you handle the algebra correctly, especially when squaring or simplifying such expressions.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding a potential value for \\(c\\), verify that it indeed leads to exactly one positive \\(b\\) and one solution for the quadratic equation. This step ensures that your solution meets all the conditions specified in the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
