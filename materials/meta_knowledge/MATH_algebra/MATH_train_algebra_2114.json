{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perimeter:** The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. For a regular polygon (where all sides are equal), the perimeter is simply the number of sides multiplied by the length of one side.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** When given relationships between the sides of two polygons, express these relationships mathematically. For instance, if one polygon's side length is twice another's, you can set up an equation involving their perimeters.\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** Once you have your equations, solve for the unknown variable systematically. Ensure that each step is logically sound and that you are solving for the correct variable.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** After solving, double-check your calculations to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. Simple mistakes can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n5. **Verification:** If possible, verify your solution by substituting the values back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy all given constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
