{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating functions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Function Substitution:** When substituting the value into the function, ensure that you replace every instance of \\( x \\) with the given value (in this case, 7).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression. This includes performing multiplication before addition or subtraction within the numerator and denominator.\n\n3. **Simplification Steps:** After substituting, simplify the expression step by step. Start by calculating the numerator and denominator separately before dividing.\n\n4. **Check for Common Errors:** Be cautious of common errors such as forgetting to subtract 1 from the denominator after substitution or incorrectly handling the addition in the numerator.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have your final answer, consider quickly re-evaluating the function mentally or with a simple calculation to ensure the answer makes sense and is correct.\n\nThese guidelines will help you minimize errors when evaluating functions like \\( f(x) = \frac{5x+1}{x-1} \\)."}
