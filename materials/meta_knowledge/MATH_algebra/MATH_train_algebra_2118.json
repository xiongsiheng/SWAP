{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Common Denominator:** When dealing with fractions, find a common denominator to combine terms. This simplifies the equation and makes it easier to solve.\n\n2. **Isolating Variables:** Aim to isolate the variable (in this case, \\(x\\)) on one side of the equation. This often involves moving terms from one side to the other using inverse operations.\n\n3. **Clearing Fractions:** Once you have a common denominator, you can multiply both sides of the equation by this denominator to clear the fractions, making the equation easier to handle.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding a potential solution, substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to ensure that no mistakes were made during the solving process.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and values when moving terms across the equation, as errors in these areas can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
