{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when performing operations with complex numbers and real numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:** When adding or subtracting complex numbers, handle the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, if you have \\( (a + bi) - (c + di) \\), subtract the real parts \\( (a - c) \\) and the imaginary parts \\( (b - d)i \\).\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms:** Ensure that you combine only like terms (real parts with real parts and imaginary parts with imaginary parts) to avoid mixing them up.\n\n3. **Simplify Carefully:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients when simplifying expressions, as errors often occur here.\n\n4. **Check Operations:** Double-check each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with negative signs.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After obtaining the final result, verify it by substituting the values back into the expression to confirm that the calculations are correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
