{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients and variables. In this case, both coefficients (145 and 29) are divisible by 29, and both terms contain \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Factor Out the GCF:** Once you identify the GCF, factor it out of each term. This simplifies the remaining expression inside the parentheses.\n\n3. **Check Your Work:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure they match the original expression. This step helps verify that no errors were made during factoring.\n\n4. **Simplify Remaining Terms:** Ensure that the terms inside the parentheses are simplified as much as possible. This often involves reducing coefficients to their simplest form.\n\n5. **Consistency in Notation:** Use consistent notation and ensure that the signs (+/-) are correctly applied throughout the factoring process.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate factoring of expressions."}
