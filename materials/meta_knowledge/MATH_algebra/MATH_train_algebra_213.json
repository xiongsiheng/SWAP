{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Quadratics:** Ensure that you correctly factor the quadratic expression. For example, \\(x^2 - 7x + 6\\) can be factored as \\((x - 6)(x - 1)\\).\n\n2. **Determining Sign Changes:** Identify the roots of the quadratic (where it equals zero) and use these points to determine the intervals where the quadratic is negative. For \\((x - 6)(x - 1)\\), the roots are \\(x = 6\\) and \\(x = 1\\).\n\n3. **Testing Intervals:** Test the sign of the quadratic in each interval determined by the roots. This involves choosing a test point in each interval and substituting it into the factored form to see if the product is negative.\n\n4. **Using Interval Notation:** Express the solution in interval notation correctly, ensuring that you include the correct endpoints (open or closed) based on whether the inequality is strict (<) or includes equality (<=).\n\n5. **Double-Check Solutions:** Substitute values from your solution intervals back into the original inequality to verify that they satisfy the inequality. This step helps catch any errors in interval selection or calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic inequalities."}
