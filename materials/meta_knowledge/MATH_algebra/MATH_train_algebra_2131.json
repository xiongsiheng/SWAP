{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Remember the midpoint formula for a segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\).\n\n2. **Slope Calculation:** The slope of a line passing through points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). Ensure you correctly apply this formula, especially when dealing with fractions.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** When expressing the slope, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms to ensure the answer is in simplest form.\n\n4. **Coordinate Geometry Basics:** Be confident in your understanding of basic coordinate geometry principles, such as calculating distances and slopes, to avoid common pitfalls.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations for both the midpoints and the slope to catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
