{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that the number of pebbles collected each day forms an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant amount (in this case, by 1 pebble per day).\n\n2. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total number of pebbles collected. The formula is \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\\), where \\(S_n\\) is the sum of the series, \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\n3. **Correct Term Calculation:** Ensure you correctly calculate the last term of the series, which is the number of pebbles collected on the last day (12th day in this case).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to your calculations, especially when multiplying and adding numbers, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by manually adding the number of pebbles collected each day up to the 12th day to ensure the sum matches your calculated result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
