{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages:** Ensure you correctly interpret percentages as parts per hundred. For example, 55% means 55 out of 100, or 0.55 in decimal form.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the information given to set up equations that represent the total number of shots made and the total number of shots taken. This often involves using variables to represent unknowns.\n\n3. **Consistent Units:** Make sure all calculations are done with consistent units (e.g., all in shots made or all in total shots). Mixing units can lead to errors.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic, especially when dealing with percentages and fractions, as these can be prone to calculation errors.\n\n5. **Logical Reasoning:** Use logical reasoning to ensure that the steps you take are consistent with the problem's requirements. For example, if the problem asks for the number of successful shots out of a new set, ensure your final answer reflects this directly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
