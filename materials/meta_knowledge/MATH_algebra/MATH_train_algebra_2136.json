{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining if pairs of lines are parallel or perpendicular, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope Identification:** Identify the slope of each line. The slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\) gives you the slope \\( m \\) directly.\n\n2. **Parallel Lines:** Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. Ensure you correctly compare the slopes of each pair of lines.\n\n3. **Perpendicular Lines:** Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\). This means that if one line has a slope \\( m \\), the other must have a slope \\( -\frac{1}{m} \\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculation:** Be precise when calculating slopes and their products. Small errors in slope calculation can lead to incorrect conclusions about parallelism or perpendicularity.\n\n5. **Systematic Pairing:** Systematically check each pair of lines once to avoid missing any pairs or double-counting. Use a table or list to keep track of which pairs you've checked.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while determining the number of good pairs of lines."}
