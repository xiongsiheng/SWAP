{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions like $(-27)^{5/3}$, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponentiation:** Break down the exponent into simpler components. For example, \\(a^{b/c}\\) can be rewritten as \\((a^{1/c})^b\\). In this case, \\((-27)^{5/3}\\) can be thought of as \\(((-27)^{1/3})^5\\).\n\n2. **Handling Negative Bases:** When dealing with negative bases raised to fractional powers, ensure that the fractional exponent's denominator is an odd number to avoid complex numbers. For instance, \\((-27)^{1/3}\\) is valid and equals \\(-3\\).\n\n3. **Calculating Powers:** After simplifying the base to its root, raise it to the remaining power. For example, if \\((-27)^{1/3} = -3\\), then \\((-3)^5 = -243\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always verify your calculations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractional exponents, as these are common sources of error.\n\n5. **Use of Calculators:** If using a calculator, ensure it handles negative numbers and fractional exponents correctly. Some calculators might require parentheses around the base and exponent to compute correctly.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy when evaluating complex expressions involving fractional exponents and negative bases."}
