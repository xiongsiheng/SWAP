{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the solutions. Identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly from the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant:** Calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\). If the discriminant is negative, the solutions will be complex numbers of the form \\(a \\pm bi\\).\n\n3. **Complex Solutions:** For complex solutions, identify the real part \\(a\\) and the imaginary part \\(b\\) correctly. Remember that \\(b\\) is the coefficient of \\(i\\) in the imaginary part.\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions:** When simplifying expressions involving square roots and fractions, ensure that you handle the arithmetic correctly, especially when combining or simplifying fractions.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the solutions, verify that they satisfy the original equation, though this is less critical for complex solutions than for real solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations with complex solutions."}
