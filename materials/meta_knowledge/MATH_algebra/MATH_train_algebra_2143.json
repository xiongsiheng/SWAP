{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:** Recognize that the odd integers between 300 and 500 form an arithmetic sequence. The first term (a) is 301, and the common difference (d) is 2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms:** Calculate the number of terms (n) in the sequence using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a + (n-1)d\\). Here, \\(a_n\\) is the last term, which is 499.\n\n3. **Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:** Use the formula for the sum (S) of an arithmetic sequence: \\(S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\\), where \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\n4. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious with calculations involving the number of terms and the sum formula. Ensure that you correctly identify the first and last terms and apply the formulas accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations for the number of terms and the sum to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
