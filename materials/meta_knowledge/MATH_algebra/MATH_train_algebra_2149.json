{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of a real-valued function involving nested radicals, consider the following:\n\n1. **Non-Negative Radicands:** For the function to yield real values, each radicand (the expression under the square root) must be non-negative. This means that \\(3 - \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{x}} \\geq 0\\), \\(5 - \\sqrt{x} \\geq 0\\), and \\(x \\geq 0\\).\n\n2. **Solving Inequalities:** Solve the inequalities step by step, starting from the innermost radical. Ensure that each step maintains the non-negativity condition.\n\n3. **Intersection of Domains:** The domain of the function is the intersection of the solutions to each inequality. This ensures that all conditions are simultaneously satisfied.\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Pay special attention to the boundaries of the inequalities, as these often define the limits of the domain.\n\n5. **Graphical or Numerical Verification:** Optionally, verify your domain by plotting the function or using numerical methods to ensure that the function is defined over the computed domain.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the domain of functions involving nested radicals."}
