{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Perpendicular Bisector Properties:** Recall that a perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that intersects the segment at its midpoint and is perpendicular to the segment. This means the slope of the bisector is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the segment.\n\n2. **Midpoint Calculation:** Accurately calculate the midpoint of the line segment using the formula: \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the endpoints of the segment.\n\n3. **Slope Calculation:** Calculate the slope of the line segment using the formula: \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\).\n\n4. **Perpendicular Slope:** Determine the slope of the perpendicular bisector, which is the negative reciprocal of the segment's slope.\n\n5. **Equation of the Line:** Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), to find the equation of the perpendicular bisector, where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is the midpoint.\n\n6. **Substitution and Solving:** Substitute the coordinates of the midpoint into the equation of the perpendicular bisector to solve for \\(b\\).\n\n7. **Verification:** Double-check all calculations and ensure that the line is indeed a perpendicular bisector by verifying the slopes are negative reciprocals and the midpoint lies on the line.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
