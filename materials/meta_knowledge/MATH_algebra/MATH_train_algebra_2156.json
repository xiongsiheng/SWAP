{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Remember that if a quantity is inversely proportional to the square of another quantity, it means that as the square of the second quantity increases, the first quantity decreases proportionally. Mathematically, if \\( F \\) is inversely proportional to \\( d^2 \\), then \\( F \\propto \frac{1}{d^2} \\).\n\n2. **Using the Proportionality Constant:** To solve problems involving inverse proportionality, determine the proportionality constant (often denoted as \\( k \\)) using the given information. For example, if \\( F = 600 \\) Newtons when \\( d = 4000 \\) miles, then \\( k = F \times d^2 \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Constant:** Once you have the proportionality constant, use it to find the force at a different distance. For instance, if \\( k = 600 \times 4000^2 \\), then the force \\( F \\) at a distance \\( d = 240,000 \\) miles can be calculated as \\( F = \frac{k}{240,000^2} \\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with large numbers and their squares. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Expressing Answers as Fractions:** When the problem requires the answer to be expressed as a fraction, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms. This ensures that the answer is in its simplest form.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
