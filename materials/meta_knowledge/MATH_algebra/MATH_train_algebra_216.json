{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation given. In this case, \\(a \\oplus b = 3a + 4b\\). This means you need to substitute \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the formula as defined.\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values correctly into the operation. For example, if you need to find \\(3 \\oplus 1\\), substitute \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 1\\) into the formula \\(3a + 4b\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved. Multiply and add the values accurately to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by performing the operation again or checking if the result makes sense given the context of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
