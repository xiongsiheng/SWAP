{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of the distinct prime factors of an expression like \\(5^5 - 5^3\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Start by factoring the expression. In this case, you can factor out the greatest common divisor of \\(5^5\\) and \\(5^3\\), which is \\(5^3\\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:** Once you have factored the expression, determine the prime factors of each factor. Remember that prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.\n\n3. **Distinct Prime Factors:** Identify the distinct prime factors from the list of all prime factors. Distinct means unique, so only count each prime factor once.\n\n4. **Sum Calculation:** Add up the distinct prime factors. Ensure you are adding only the distinct primes and not repeating any.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your factorization and the calculation of the sum to ensure accuracy. Mistakes often occur in factorization and arithmetic.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
