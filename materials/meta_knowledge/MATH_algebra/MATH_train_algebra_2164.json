{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Always follow the correct order of operations: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\n2. **Simplifying Exponents:** When dealing with exponents, simplify them according to the rules of exponents. For example, \\(a^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) is the same as \\(\\sqrt{a}\\).\n\n3. **Multiplication and Division:** Perform multiplication and division from left to right, ensuring that you handle each operation in the correct sequence.\n\n4. **Radicals and Exponents:** Be aware that \\(\\sqrt{a}\\) is equivalent to \\(a^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), and \\(a^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\) can be expressed as \\(\\sqrt{a^3}\\) or \\(a\\sqrt{a}\\).\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with mixed operations involving radicals and exponents, as these can be prone to errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
