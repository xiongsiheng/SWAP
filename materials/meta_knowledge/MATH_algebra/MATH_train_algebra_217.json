{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For example, \\( f(g(x)) \\) means you substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting functions into each other, ensure you substitute correctly and simplify the resulting expression step by step.\n\n3. **Equality of Functions:** When given that two expressions are equal, equate them term by term and solve for the unknowns. This often involves setting up and solving equations.\n\n4. **Checking Constraints:** Always check the constraints given in the problem, such as \\( A \neq B \\), to ensure your solution adheres to these conditions.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with variables and constants, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute your final values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) back into the original function compositions to verify that the given condition \\( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A \\) holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
