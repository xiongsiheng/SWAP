{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance from the origin to a point in a rectangular coordinate system, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Use the Distance Formula:** The distance \\(d\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the formula \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). For the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and the point \\((-15, 8)\\), this simplifies to \\(d = \\sqrt{(-15 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Squaring Correctly:** Ensure that you square the differences correctly. For example, \\((-15)^2 = 225\\) and \\(8^2 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Adding and Taking the Square Root:** After squaring the differences, add them together and then take the square root of the sum. This step is crucial as errors in addition or square root extraction can lead to incorrect distances.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations for squaring, adding, and taking the square root to avoid simple arithmetic mistakes.\n\n5. **Use Positive Values:** Remember that the distance formula always results in a positive value, as distance cannot be negative.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating distances in a rectangular coordinate system."}
