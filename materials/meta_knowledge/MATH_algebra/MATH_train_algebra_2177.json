{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Definition:** Recall that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line. Therefore, \\(|5x - 3| \\le 7\\) means that \\(5x - 3\\) is within 7 units of zero.\n\n2. **Inequality Conversion:** Convert the absolute value inequality into a compound inequality. For \\(|5x - 3| \\le 7\\), this translates to \\(-7 \\le 5x - 3 \\le 7\\).\n\n3. **Solving Compound Inequalities:** Solve the compound inequality by isolating \\(x\\) in the middle. Add 3 to all parts of the inequality to get \\(-4 \\le 5x \\le 10\\), then divide by 5 to find the range of \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Integer Solutions:** Determine which integers fall within the range found. Ensure you count all integers inclusively between the bounds of the inequality.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by substituting the integers back into the original inequality to confirm they satisfy the condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
