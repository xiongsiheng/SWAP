{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). The nth term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as \\(a \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term.\n\n2. **Identifying the Common Ratio:** In a geometric sequence, the common ratio can be found by dividing any term by the previous term. For example, if the fifth term is \\(7!\\) and the eighth term is \\(8!\\), the common ratio can be found by dividing \\(8!\\) by \\(7!\\), which simplifies to 8.\n\n3. **Using the Formula for the nth Term:** Use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence to set up equations. For instance, if the fifth term is \\(7!\\) and the eighth term is \\(8!\\), you can set up the equations \\(a \\cdot r^4 = 7!\\) and \\(a \\cdot r^7 = 8!\\).\n\n4. **Solving for the First Term:** By equating the expressions for the common ratio and substituting, solve for the first term \\(a\\). This involves careful algebraic manipulation to isolate \\(a\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the first term, verify your solution by substituting it back into the sequence formula to ensure it matches the given terms.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving geometric sequences."}
