{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n2. **Handling Positive and Negative Differences:** Be aware that the common difference can be positive or negative, affecting the direction of the sequence (increasing or decreasing).\n\n3. **Calculating Specific Terms:** When finding the 51st term, substitute \\(n = 51\\) into the formula. Ensure you correctly calculate \\((n-1)d\\) for each sequence.\n\n4. **Absolute Value Calculations:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. When finding the absolute value of the difference between two terms, ensure you correctly compute the difference before applying the absolute value.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with large numbers or multiple steps, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
