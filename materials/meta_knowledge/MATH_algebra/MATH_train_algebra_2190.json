{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Ensure you correctly interpret the defined operation. In this case, \\(a \\star b = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) is a specific operation that combines squares and products of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values into the operation, do so carefully to avoid misplacing or mistyping the numbers.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved, especially squaring and multiplication, as these can be prone to errors if not done carefully.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After performing the operations, simplify the expression step by step to ensure all calculations are correct.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by checking if the operation \\(a \\star b\\) can be simplified to a known form (e.g., \\((a + b)^2\\)) and then substituting the values to see if it matches your calculated result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
