{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Consecutive Roots:** Recognize that if the roots of the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - nx + m = 0\\) are consecutive positive integers, say \\(a\\) and \\(a+1\\), then \\(n = a + (a+1) = 2a + 1\\) and \\(m = a(a+1)\\).\n\n2. **Divisibility Condition:** Ensure that \\(m = a(a+1)\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(a\\) and \\(a+1\\) are consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Range of \\(n\\):** Since \\(n < 100\\), you need to find the range of \\(a\\) such that \\(2a + 1 < 100\\). This simplifies to \\(a < 49.5\\), so \\(a\\) ranges from 1 to 49.\n\n4. **Counting Valid \\(a\\):** Count how many integers \\(a\\) in the range 1 to 49 make \\(m\\) divisible by 3. Since one of every three consecutive integers is divisible by 3, you can divide 49 by 3 to get the approximate number of valid \\(a\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure that the count of valid \\(n\\) is correct, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
