{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Order:** Substitute the given values into the expression step by step, starting with the innermost variable and moving outward. This helps avoid confusion and ensures that each substitution is applied correctly.\n\n2. **Check for Zero Denominators:** Although it's given that none of the denominators are zero, it's good practice to quickly verify that substituting the given values does not inadvertently create a zero in any denominator.\n\n3. **Simplify Each Fraction:** Simplify each fraction individually before multiplying them together. This can often simplify the overall expression and make the multiplication easier.\n\n4. **Multiplication of Fractions:** When multiplying fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together separately. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After obtaining the final answer, it's a good idea to re-substitute the original values back into the expression to verify that the answer is consistent with the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
