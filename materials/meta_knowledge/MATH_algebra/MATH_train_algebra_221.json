{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given equation \\( h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \\) represents a quadratic equation in terms of time \\( t \\). The equation describes the height \\( h \\) of the ball at any given time \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find the time when the ball reaches a specific height (in this case, 25 feet), set \\( h \\) equal to 25 and solve for \\( t \\). This will involve solving the quadratic equation \\( 25 = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use the quadratic formula \\( t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = -6 \\), \\( b = -7 \\), and \\( c = 20 \\) (after rearranging the equation to \\( -6t^2 - 7t + 20 = 0 \\)). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Checking for Real Solutions:** Calculate the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) to ensure it is non-negative, which guarantees real solutions for \\( t \\).\n\n5. **Interpreting Solutions:** If you obtain two positive solutions for \\( t \\), consider the context of the problem to determine which solution is meaningful (e.g., the first time the ball reaches 25 feet).\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the calculated time(s) back into the original height equation to verify that the height does indeed equal 25 feet at those times.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
