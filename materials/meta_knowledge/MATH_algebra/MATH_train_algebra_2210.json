{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Geometric Sequence Formula:** Recall that the nth term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Common Ratio Calculation:** Calculate the common ratio \\(r\\) by dividing the second term by the first term: \\(r = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\).\n\n3. **Exponential Growth:** Understand that in a geometric sequence, terms grow exponentially. This means that the sequence can quickly reach very large numbers, which is relevant when determining when a term is divisible by a large number like one million.\n\n4. **Divisibility Rules:** Be familiar with the prime factorization of one million (\\(10^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^6\\)). This helps in determining when a number is divisible by one million.\n\n5. **Logarithmic Approach:** Sometimes, using logarithms can simplify finding the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n\\) is divisible by one million. This involves solving for \\(n\\) in the equation \\(a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1} = 10^6\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding a potential \\(n\\), verify by calculating the actual \\(n\\)th term and checking its divisibility by one million. This step ensures that your solution is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
