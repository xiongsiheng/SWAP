{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Area Calculations:** Ensure you correctly calculate the area of both the square and the rectangle. The area of a square with side length \\( (x-2) \\) is \\( (x-2)^2 \\), and the area of a rectangle with length \\( (x-3) \\) and width \\( (x+4) \\) is \\( (x-3)(x+4) \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Set up the equation correctly based on the given relationship between the areas. In this case, the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the square, so you would set up the equation \\( (x-3)(x+4) = 2(x-2)^2 \\).\n\n3. **Expanding and Simplifying:** When expanding and simplifying the equation, be meticulous with each step. Ensure you distribute correctly and combine like terms accurately.\n\n4. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When solving the resulting quadratic equation, use appropriate methods such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Check for extraneous solutions by ensuring they satisfy the original equation.\n\n5. **Sum of Roots:** If you need to find the sum of the possible values of \\( x \\), remember that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is given by \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy the problem's requirements.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
