{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Squares of Binomials:** Recognize that the square of a binomial (x + b) is \\(x^2 + 2bx + b^2\\). This form helps in identifying the coefficients of the quadratic expression.\n\n2. **Matching Coefficients:** When a quadratic is a perfect square, its form must match \\(x^2 + 2bx + b^2\\). Therefore, compare the given quadratic's coefficients with this standard form to find 'a' and 'b'.\n\n3. **Coefficient Relationships:** The coefficient of x in the quadratic must be twice the square root of the constant term for the quadratic to be a perfect square. Use this relationship to solve for 'a'.\n\n4. **Checking the Form:** Ensure that the quadratic fits the form \\(ax^2 + 2bx + b^2\\) exactly, as slight deviations can indicate an incorrect solution.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the found value of 'a' back into the quadratic to confirm it can be expressed as the square of a binomial. This step is crucial to verify the correctness of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
