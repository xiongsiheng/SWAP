{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Factoring:** Recognize that factoring a quadratic expression like \\(5x^2 + nx + 48\\) into two linear factors with integer coefficients means finding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\((5x + a)(x + b) = 5x^2 + nx + 48\\). This implies \\(ab = 48\\) and \\(5b + a = n\\).\n\n2. **Integer Coefficients:** Ensure that the factors have integer coefficients. This constraint significantly narrows down the possible values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Pairing Factors:** List all pairs of integers \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(ab = 48\\). Calculate \\(n\\) for each pair using the formula \\(n = 5b + a\\).\n\n4. **Maximizing \\(n\\):** To find the largest value of \\(n\\), evaluate \\(n\\) for each pair and select the maximum value.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check that each selected pair indeed factors the quadratic expression correctly to ensure no arithmetic or logical errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
