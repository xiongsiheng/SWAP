{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( x \\) that makes the expression equal to zero, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Zero in Fractions:** A fraction is equal to zero if and only if its numerator is zero (provided the denominator is not zero at the same time). Therefore, set the numerator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Avoiding Division by Zero:** Ensure that the value of \\( x \\) you find does not make the denominator zero, as this would make the fraction undefined.\n\n3. **Simple Equation Solving:** Solve the resulting equation from setting the numerator to zero carefully, as it typically involves straightforward arithmetic operations.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, substitute the value of \\( x \\) back into the original expression to confirm it indeed makes the expression equal to zero.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the value of \\( x \\) that makes the expression equal to zero."}
