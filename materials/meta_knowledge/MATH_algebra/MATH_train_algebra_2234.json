{"Knowledge": "To determine the number of terms in the expansion of a product of two polynomials, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Remember that each term in the first polynomial must be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. This is a direct application of the distributive property.\n\n2. **Counting Terms:** To find the total number of terms in the resulting expansion, multiply the number of terms in the first polynomial by the number of terms in the second polynomial. For example, if the first polynomial has \\( m \\) terms and the second polynomial has \\( n \\) terms, the total number of terms in the expansion will be \\( m \times n \\).\n\n3. **Avoiding Duplicates:** Ensure that you account for any identical terms that may arise from the multiplication. If the same term appears more than once, it should be counted only once in the final tally.\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check your count by manually listing out a few sample products to confirm that your method is correct.\n\nBy applying these principles, you can accurately determine the number of terms in the expansion of such polynomial products."}
