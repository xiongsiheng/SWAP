{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identifying the Vertex of a Parabola:** The vertex of a parabola given by \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is located at \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\). For the parabola \\( y = x^2 + a^2 \\), the vertex is at \\( x = 0 \\), so the vertex is \\( (0, a^2) \\).\n\n2. **Intersection of Line and Parabola:** To find where the line \\( y = x + a \\) passes through the vertex of the parabola, set the coordinates of the vertex equal to the equation of the line: \\( a^2 = 0 + a \\). This simplifies to \\( a^2 = a \\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When solving \\( a^2 = a \\), remember to set the equation to zero: \\( a^2 - a = 0 \\). Factor the equation to find the solutions: \\( a(a - 1) = 0 \\), which gives \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( a = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Counting Solutions:** Be sure to count the number of distinct solutions. In this case, there are two distinct values of \\( a \\) that satisfy the condition.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the values of \\( a \\) back into the original conditions to verify that the line indeed passes through the vertex of the parabola for those values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
