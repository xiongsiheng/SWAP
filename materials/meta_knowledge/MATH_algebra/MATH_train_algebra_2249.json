{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving an invertible function and its graph, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Properties:** Understand that for an invertible function, each \\( x \\) value corresponds to a unique \\( y \\) value and vice versa. This means that if \\( f(a) = b \\), then \\( a \\) is the unique input that produces \\( b \\). Similarly, if \\( f(b) = 4 \\), then \\( b \\) is the unique input that produces 4.\n\n2. **Graph Interpretation:** Use the graph to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Locate the points where the graph intersects the lines \\( y = b \\) and \\( y = 4 \\). These points will give you the corresponding \\( x \\)-values, which are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), respectively.\n\n3. **Accuracy in Reading Graphs:** Be precise when reading values from the graph. Use the grid lines and tick marks to accurately determine the coordinates of points.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from the graph, verify by substituting these values back into the function to ensure they satisfy the given conditions \\( f(a) = b \\) and \\( f(b) = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Arithmetic Check:** After calculating \\( a - b \\), double-check the arithmetic to ensure there are no calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems involving invertible functions and their graphs."}
