{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** When converting a quadratic expression into the form \\((x + b)^2 + c\\), you need to complete the square. This involves transforming the quadratic term and the linear term into a perfect square trinomial plus a constant.\n\n2. **Identifying Coefficients:** Accurately identify the coefficients in the quadratic expression \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\). In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1300\\), and \\(c = 1300\\).\n\n3. **Forming the Perfect Square:** To complete the square, take half of the linear coefficient \\(b\\), square it, and then adjust the constant term to maintain equality. Specifically, for \\(x^2 + 1300x + 1300\\), half of 1300 is 650, and \\(650^2 = 422500\\). Thus, the expression becomes \\((x + 650)^2 - 422500 + 1300\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Expression:** Combine the constants correctly after completing the square. In this case, \\(-422500 + 1300 = -421200\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Ratio:** Once you have the expression in the form \\((x + b)^2 + c\\), identify \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) and then compute the ratio \\(\frac{c}{b}\\). For this problem, \\(b = 650\\) and \\(c = -421200\\).\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed correctly, especially when squaring numbers and combining constants, as these steps are prone to errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
