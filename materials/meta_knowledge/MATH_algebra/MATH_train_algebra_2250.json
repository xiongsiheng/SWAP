{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that the time taken for each flight of stairs forms an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant amount (5 seconds in this case).\n\n2. **Formula for Arithmetic Series:** Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n) \\), where \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and \\( a_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th term.\n\n3. **Calculating the \\( n \\)-th Term:** To find the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence, use the formula \\( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\), where \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\n4. **Attention to Detail:** Ensure that you correctly identify the first term (\\( a_1 \\)) and the common difference (\\( d \\)) in the sequence. In this problem, \\( a_1 = 20 \\) seconds and \\( d = 5 \\) seconds.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the total time, consider manually adding the times for each flight to verify your result, as this step can catch errors in the application of the formula.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving arithmetic sequences."}
