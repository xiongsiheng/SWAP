{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Recognize and apply algebraic identities to simplify expressions. In this case, the expression can be simplified using the difference of squares formula: \\((a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2 = 4ab\\).\n\n2. **Exponent Rules:** Understand the properties of exponents, such as \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\). This helps in simplifying and combining terms with exponents.\n\n3. **Factorization:** Be proficient in factoring expressions, especially when dealing with sums and differences of squares or cubes.\n\n4. **Numerical Calculations:** Be careful with numerical calculations, especially when dealing with large exponents. Simplify the problem step by step to avoid computational errors.\n\n5. **Checking Units and Orders of Magnitude:** Ensure that the final answer makes sense in terms of the magnitude and units involved. This helps in verifying the plausibility of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
