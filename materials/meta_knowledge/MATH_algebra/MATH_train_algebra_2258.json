{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of the x-intercept and y-intercept of a line described by an equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Intercepts:** The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis, which occurs when y = 0. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which occurs when x = 0.\n\n2. **Substituting Values:** To find the x-intercept, substitute y = 0 into the equation and solve for x. To find the y-intercept, substitute x = 0 into the equation and solve for y.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform arithmetic operations accurately, especially when simplifying expressions after substitution.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for both intercepts to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Summing Intercepts:** After finding both intercepts, add them together. Ensure that you are adding the correct values (x-intercept and y-intercept) and not mixing them up.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the sum of the intercepts of a line."}
