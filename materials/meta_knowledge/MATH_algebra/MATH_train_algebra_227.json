{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( f(f(x)) \\) means applying the function \\( f \\) twice. First, calculate \\( f(x) \\) and then use that result as the input for another application of \\( f \\).\n\n2. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into the function, ensure that you substitute correctly. For example, if \\( f(x) = 3x^2 - 5 \\), then \\( f(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5 \\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions. This ensures that you perform multiplication and exponentiation before subtraction.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each step, double-check your calculations to catch any arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have the final value, consider re-evaluating the entire process from the start to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
