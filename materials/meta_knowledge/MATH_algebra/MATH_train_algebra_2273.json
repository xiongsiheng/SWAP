{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly translate the problem into mathematical equations. For this problem, you should set up two equations: one for the sum and one for the difference.\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When solving for two variables using two equations, use the method of substitution or elimination correctly. Make sure to isolate one variable first and then substitute or add/subtract the equations appropriately.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of the two numbers, verify that they satisfy both the sum and the difference conditions mentioned in the problem.\n\n4. **Identifying the Greater Number:** Once you have the values of the two numbers, clearly identify which one is greater. This step is straightforward but important to ensure the correct final answer.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the signs and operations, especially when dealing with differences, as errors in signs can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
