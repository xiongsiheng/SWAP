{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining which functions are invertible and finding the product of their labels, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Invertibility:** A function is invertible if and only if it is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective). For a function to be one-to-one, each output must correspond to exactly one input. For a function to be onto, every possible output must be achieved by some input.\n\n2. **Graphical Representation:** For continuous functions, a function is invertible if and only if its graph passes the horizontal line test. This means that any horizontal line drawn on the graph intersects the function at most once.\n\n3. **Discrete Functions:** For functions defined on a discrete set of points, like function (3), check that each output is produced by exactly one input.\n\n4. **Domain and Range:** Consider the domain and range of each function. A function is invertible if its domain and range are such that each element in the range is mapped from exactly one element in the domain.\n\n5. **Calculating the Product:** Once you identify the labels of the invertible functions, multiply these labels together. Ensure you perform the multiplication accurately to get the correct product.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your identification of invertible functions and the multiplication of their labels to avoid errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
