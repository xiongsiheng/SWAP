{"Knowledge": "To determine the slope of a line parallel to another line, remember the following:\n\n1. **Slope-Intercept Form:** Convert the given line equation to slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m represents the slope.\n\n2. **Parallel Lines:** Parallel lines have the same slope. Once you identify the slope of the given line, you know the slope of any line parallel to it.\n\n3. **Fraction Representation:** Ensure that the slope is expressed as a common fraction, maintaining the exact form of the ratio between the coefficients of x and y.\n\n4. **Avoid Simplification Errors:** When converting the equation to slope-intercept form, be careful with algebraic manipulations to avoid errors in calculating the slope.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the slope of a line parallel to the given line."}
