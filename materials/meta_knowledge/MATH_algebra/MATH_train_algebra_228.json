{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Recall algebraic identities such as the difference of squares, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\). This identity can simplify the solution process.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** When given a system of equations, solve for one variable in terms of the other using one equation, then substitute into the other equation to find the values of the variables.\n\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:** After substituting the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the expression \\(a^2 - b^2\\), ensure that you simplify the expression correctly, paying attention to the order of operations.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations, especially when substituting and simplifying, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) satisfy both original equations, as this will confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
