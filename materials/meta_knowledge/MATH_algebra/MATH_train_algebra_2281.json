{"Knowledge": "To determine the range of the function \\( G(x) = |x+1| - |x-1| \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Properties:** Remember that the absolute value function \\( |x| \\) is always non-negative, i.e., \\( |x| \\geq 0 \\). This property is crucial when analyzing the behavior of \\( G(x) \\).\n\n2. **Critical Points:** Identify the points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign, which are \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\). These points divide the real line into intervals where the function \\( G(x) \\) can be expressed differently.\n\n3. **Interval Analysis:** Analyze the function in each interval determined by the critical points. For each interval, simplify \\( G(x) \\) by removing the absolute values based on the sign of \\( x+1 \\) and \\( x-1 \\).\n\n4. **Function Behavior:** Determine how \\( G(x) \\) behaves in each interval. Specifically, check whether \\( G(x) \\) is increasing, decreasing, or constant, and find the minimum and maximum values it attains.\n\n5. **Combining Results:** Combine the results from each interval to determine the overall range of \\( G(x) \\). Express this range in interval notation.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the range of the function \\( G(x) \\)."}
