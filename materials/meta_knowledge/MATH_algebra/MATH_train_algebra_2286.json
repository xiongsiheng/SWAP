{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cubing Both Sides:** When you cube both sides of an equation to eliminate the cube root, ensure that the expressions on both sides are correctly cubed. This operation should be straightforward if done carefully.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** After eliminating the cube root, you may end up with a quadratic equation. Use the quadratic formula or factoring techniques to find the roots, and be meticulous with the arithmetic involved.\n\n3. **Identifying Real Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions you find are real numbers, as complex solutions might not be relevant depending on the context of the problem.\n\n4. **Calculating Differences:** When finding the positive difference between two solutions, simply subtract the smaller number from the larger one. This step should be straightforward but double-check the order to ensure the difference is positive.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to verify they are correct. This step is crucial to catch any errors in the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
