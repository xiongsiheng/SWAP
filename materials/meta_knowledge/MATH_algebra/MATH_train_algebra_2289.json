{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Averages:** The average of a set of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers. In this case, the sum of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages divided by 3 equals 9.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the given information into algebraic equations. For instance, if the average of three ages is 9, you can write the equation as \\(\\frac{A + B + C}{3} = 9\\), where A, B, and C represent Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages, respectively.\n\n3. **Handling Time Shifts:** When dealing with ages at different points in time, adjust the ages accordingly. For example, if four years ago Chris was the same age as Amy is now, you can express this as \\(C - 4 = A\\).\n\n4. **Relating Future Ages:** Express relationships between future ages using the information given. For instance, if in 3 years Ben's age will be \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of Amy's age at that time, you can write \\(B + 3 = \\frac{2}{3}(A + 3)\\).\n\n5. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Use the equations derived from the problem to solve for the unknowns. This often involves substitution or elimination methods to find the values of the variables.\n\n6. **Verification:** After solving for the ages, verify that all conditions given in the problem are satisfied by substituting the values back into the original conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
