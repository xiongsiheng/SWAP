{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Arithmetic Sequences:** Understand the properties of arithmetic sequences, including how to find the nth term and the sum of a sequence. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n2. **Counting Digits:** Be aware of how to count the number of digits in a number. For example, the number 123 has three digits.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Patterns:** Recognize patterns and symmetries in the problem. In this case, the addresses on both sides of the street form similar sequences, which can simplify calculations.\n\n4. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the details of the problem, such as the cost per digit and the total number of houses, to ensure accurate calculations.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure that you have correctly applied the arithmetic sequence formulas and counted the digits accurately.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
