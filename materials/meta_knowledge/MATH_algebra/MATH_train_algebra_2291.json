{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when dealing with the greatest integer function (also known as the floor function), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Definition of the Floor Function:** The notation $[x]$ or $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. This means you need to find the largest integer that does not exceed $x$.\n\n2. **Negative Numbers:** When dealing with negative numbers, the floor function can be counterintuitive. For example, $[-1.2]$ is not $-1$, but rather $-2$, because $-2$ is the largest integer less than or equal to $-1.2$.\n\n3. **Decimal Points:** Always focus on the integer part of the number and determine if the next integer is less than or equal to the given number. For negative decimals, this often means rounding 'down' to the next more negative integer.\n\n4. **Consistency in Interpretation:** Ensure consistent interpretation of the floor function across different problems to avoid mixing up the rules for positive and negative numbers.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating, verify your answer by ensuring it is indeed the largest integer less than or equal to the given number. This step helps catch any misinterpretations or calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving the greatest integer function."}
