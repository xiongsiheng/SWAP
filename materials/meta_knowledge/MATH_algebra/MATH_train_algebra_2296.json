{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pythagorean Identity:** Recall that for any real numbers \\( r \\) and \\( s \\), \\( r^2 + s^2 = 1 \\) implies that \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) can be thought of as the sine and cosine of some angle, or as coordinates on the unit circle.\n\n2. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Be familiar with algebraic identities such as \\( (r^2 + s^2)^2 = r^4 + 2r^2s^2 + s^4 \\). This identity can be used to relate the given equations.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When you derive a quadratic equation in terms of \\( rs \\), use the quadratic formula carefully to find the correct roots. Ensure that you only consider positive values for \\( rs \\) as specified in the problem.\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:** After finding a potential value for \\( rs \\), verify that it satisfies both original equations to ensure consistency.\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Errors:** Common errors include misapplying algebraic identities or making mistakes in the arithmetic of exponents. Double-check all calculations, especially when squaring or taking roots.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
