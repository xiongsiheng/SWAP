{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding and finding the sum of coefficients in this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly, ensuring that each term in the first parenthesis is multiplied by each term in the second parenthesis.\n\n2. **Handling Negatives:** Be cautious with negative signs. For example, when expanding \\(-(3-c)\\), remember that it equals \\(-3 + c\\), not \\(-3 - c\\).\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms carefully to simplify the expression. This step is crucial for correctly identifying and summing the coefficients.\n\n4. **Sum of Coefficients:** To find the sum of the coefficients, set all variables to 1 and evaluate the expression. This method works because the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is the value of the polynomial when all variables are set to 1.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each step, double-check your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors, especially in multiplication and addition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
