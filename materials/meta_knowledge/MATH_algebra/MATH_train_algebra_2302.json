{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving systems of linear equations, consider the following:\n\n1. **Elimination Method:** When using the elimination method, ensure you multiply the entire equation correctly to align coefficients for subtraction or addition. Misaligning coefficients can lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** If using the substitution method, correctly isolate one variable and substitute it into the other equation. Missteps in isolating or substituting can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations during elimination or substitution. Simple arithmetic mistakes can distort the final solution.\n\n4. **Check Solutions:** After finding the values of individual variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify they satisfy both equations. This step helps catch any errors made during the solving process.\n\n5. **Combining Solutions:** When finding the value of an expression like \\(u + v\\), ensure you use the correct values of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) obtained from solving the system. Using incorrect values will lead to a wrong final answer.\n\nThese guidelines should help minimize errors while solving systems of linear equations."}
