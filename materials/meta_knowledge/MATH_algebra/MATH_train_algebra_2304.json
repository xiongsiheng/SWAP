{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Define variables for the number of boys and girls in the school. For example, let \\( G \\) represent the number of girls and \\( B \\) represent the number of boys.\n\n2. **Using Given Information:** Use the information provided to set up equations. In this case, you know the total number of students and the number attending the picnic.\n\n3. **Fractional Relationships:** Understand how to use fractions correctly in equations. For instance, if two-thirds of the girls attend the picnic, this can be represented as \\( \frac{2}{3}G \\).\n\n4. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Combine the equations to solve for the variables. Ensure you correctly add and subtract terms to isolate the variable of interest.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to avoid common mistakes in calculations.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you find the number of girls attending the picnic, verify by checking if the total number of students attending the picnic matches the given data.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
