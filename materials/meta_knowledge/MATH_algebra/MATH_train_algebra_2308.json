{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Integer Solutions of Quadratic Equations:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have integer solutions, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be a perfect square. In this case, the discriminant is \\(k^2 + 48\\).\n\n2. **Factorization:** If the quadratic equation has integer solutions, it can be factored into \\((x - p)(x - q) = 0\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the integer solutions. From this, you can derive that \\(k = p + q\\) and \\(pq = -12\\).\n\n3. **Systematic Checking:** List all pairs of integers whose product is \\(-12\\) and calculate \\(k\\) for each pair. Ensure that you consider both positive and negative pairs.\n\n4. **Sum of Values:** Once you have identified all valid values of \\(k\\), sum them up. This step requires careful addition to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify each value of \\(k\\) by substituting back into the original equation to confirm that it yields integer solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
