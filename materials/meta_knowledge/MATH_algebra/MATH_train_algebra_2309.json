{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Transformations:** Understand how transformations like horizontal shifts (e.g., $h(x-3)$) affect the graph of a function. A horizontal shift to the right by $k$ units is represented by $h(x-k)$.\n\n2. **Intersection Points:** When two graphs intersect, their equations are equal at the intersection point. Set the equations of the two graphs equal to each other to find the intersection point.\n\n3. **Graph Reading:** Accurately read the coordinates from the graph of $y=h(x)$. Pay attention to the scale and markings on the axes to avoid misreading values.\n\n4. **Coordinate Sum:** Once you find the intersection point, add its coordinates together. Ensure you are adding the correct values and performing the arithmetic accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking if the point of intersection satisfies both original and transformed function equations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
