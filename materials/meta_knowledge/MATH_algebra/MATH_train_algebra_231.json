{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for partial fractions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Factors:** Ensure that the denominator of the original fraction is correctly factored. For this problem, \\(x^2 - 7x - 30\\) factors into \\((x - 10)(x + 3)\\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Partial Fractions:** When setting up the partial fractions, make sure each factor of the denominator gets its own fraction. In this case, it should be \\(\frac{A}{x - 10} + \frac{B}{x + 3}\\).\n\n3. **Clear the Denominators:** Multiply through by the common denominator \\((x - 10)(x + 3)\\) to clear the fractions. This step is crucial to avoid errors in setting up the equation.\n\n4. **Solve for Constants:** Equate the numerators and solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Use strategic values for \\(x\\) to simplify the equations, such as \\(x = 10\\) and \\(x = -3\\), which directly isolate \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) respectively.\n\n5. **Substitute and Verify:** After finding \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), substitute them back into the original setup to verify that the decomposition is correct. This step ensures that no algebraic mistakes were made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving partial fraction decomposition problems."}
