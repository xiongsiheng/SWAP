{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation $\\star$. In this case, $(a \\star b) = \frac{a + b}{a - b}$. Ensure you apply this definition correctly.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Perform the operations in the correct sequence. Start by calculating $1 \\star 2$ first, then use the result to calculate $((1 \\star 2) \\star 3)$.\n\n3. **Fraction Handling:** Be careful when dealing with fractions, especially when combining them. Simplify each step as much as possible to avoid complex fractions that are prone to errors.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute values accurately and simplify expressions step by step. Ensure that each substitution and simplification is done correctly to avoid cascading errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After completing the calculation, double-check each step to ensure that no arithmetic or substitution errors were made.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
