{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rationalizing Denominators:** When dealing with expressions like \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\), multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) to rationalize the denominator, resulting in \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\). Do the same for \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After rationalizing the denominators, combine the terms that share the same radicals. For example, combine \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}\\) into a single term.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions:** When combining terms, ensure that the resulting fraction is in its simplest form. This involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients and simplifying accordingly.\n\n4. **Minimizing the Denominator:** To find the smallest possible value of \\(c\\), simplify the fraction such that the denominator is as small as possible while ensuring that the numerator remains in the form of \\(a\\sqrt{5} + b\\sqrt{7}\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), verify that the original expression equals \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{5} + b\\sqrt{7}}{c}\\) to ensure correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
