{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating logarithmic expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithm Definition:** Recall that \\(\\log_b a = x\\) means \\(b^x = a\\). This definition is crucial for setting up and solving logarithmic equations.\n\n2. **Properties of Logarithms:** Be familiar with the properties of logarithms, such as the change of base formula \\(\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_k a}{\\log_k b}\\), which can simplify calculations.\n\n3. **Base and Argument Relationships:** Understand how the base and the argument of a logarithm affect the value. For example, \\(\\log_\\frac{1}{3} 9\\) involves a base less than 1 and an argument greater than 1, which typically results in a negative value.\n\n4. **Calculating with Exponents:** Remember that \\(\\log_b a\\) can be found by determining the exponent to which b must be raised to get a. For instance, \\(\\log_\\frac{1}{3} 9\\) involves understanding that \\((\\frac{1}{3})^x = 9\\).\n\n5. **Checking Your Answer:** After calculating, verify your answer by converting it back to the exponential form to ensure it satisfies the original logarithmic equation.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in evaluating logarithmic expressions."}
