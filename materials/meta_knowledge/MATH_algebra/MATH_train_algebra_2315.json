{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Compound Interest:** Compound interest is calculated based on the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is \\(A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal), \\(n\\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and \\(t\\) is the time the money is invested for.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** In this problem, the interest is compounded monthly, so \\(n = 12\\) and \\(t\\) is the number of months. You need to find the smallest integer \\(t\\) such that \\(A > 2P\\).\n\n3. **Solving for t:** Rearrange the compound interest formula to solve for \\(t\\) when \\(A = 2P\\). This involves taking the natural logarithm of both sides to isolate \\(t\\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and logarithms, as these are common areas for errors.\n\n5. **Rounding Up:** Since you are looking for the least integer number of months, ensure you round up any fractional results to the next whole number.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
