{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Infinite Nested Radicals:** Recognize that expressions of the form \\(\\sqrt{a + \\sqrt{a + \\sqrt{a + \\cdots}}}\\) can be set equal to \\(x\\) and then solved as an equation \\(x = \\sqrt{a + x}\\). This approach simplifies the problem into a more manageable form.\n\n2. **Solving for \\(x\\):** When you have \\(x = \\sqrt{a + x}\\), square both sides to eliminate the square root: \\(x^2 = a + x\\). Rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation form: \\(x^2 - x - a = 0\\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Solutions:** Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(c = -a\\). Choose the positive root since \\(x\\) represents a length or magnitude.\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding the solution, verify it by substituting back into the original nested radical expression to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n\n5. **Avoiding Extraneous Solutions:** Be cautious of extraneous solutions that might arise from squaring both sides. Only solutions that satisfy the original form of the nested radical are valid.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
