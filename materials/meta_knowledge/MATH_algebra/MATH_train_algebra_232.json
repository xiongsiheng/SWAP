{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating compound percentages and final amounts, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages:** A 1% increase means multiplying the current amount by 1.01. This is because 1% is equivalent to 0.01, and adding this to 1 gives 1.01.\n\n2. **Sequential Increases:** When a value is increased by a percentage more than once, each increase is applied to the result of the previous increase. This is known as compound interest.\n\n3. **Calculating Step-by-Step:** To avoid errors, calculate each percentage increase separately. First, calculate the increase after the first period, then use this new amount to calculate the increase for the next period.\n\n4. **Using Correct Formulas:** Ensure you use the correct formula for percentage increase, which is \\(\\text{New Amount} = \\text{Original Amount} \\times (1 + \\text{Percentage})\\).\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** After performing the calculations, double-check each step to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with multiple percentage increases.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating the final amount after multiple percentage increases."}
