{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** The formula for compound interest is \\(A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(n\\) years, including interest, \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal), \\(n\\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and \\(t\\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\n\n2. **Simple Interest Formula:** The formula for simple interest is \\(A = P(1 + rt)\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(t\\) years, including interest, \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate, and \\(t\\) is the number of years.\n\n3. **Interest Rates:** Ensure that the interest rates are correctly converted from percentages to decimals (e.g., 5% becomes 0.05).\n\n4. **Time Period:** Make sure to use the correct time period (in this case, 15 years) in the calculations.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Use a calculator to ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with exponents in the compound interest formula.\n\n6. **Difference Calculation:** When calculating the positive difference between the two balances, subtract the smaller balance from the larger balance to ensure the result is positive.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
