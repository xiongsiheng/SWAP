{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring polynomial expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Combine Like Terms:** Start by combining like terms within the expression. This simplifies the polynomial and makes it easier to factor.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property (also known as factoring out the greatest common factor) to factor out any common factors from all terms.\n\n3. **Difference of Squares/Cubes:** Recognize and apply the difference of squares or cubes formulas if applicable.\n\n4. **Grouping:** For polynomials that do not immediately reveal a common factor, consider grouping terms that can be factored together.\n\n5. **Double-Check Factoring:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure they correctly reproduce the original polynomial.\n\n6. **Simplify Completely:** Make sure the factored form is as simplified as possible, with no further common factors remaining.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and completeness in factoring polynomial expressions."}
