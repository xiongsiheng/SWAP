{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Difference of Squares:** Recognize that the expression involves a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the algebraic identity \\((a + b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2) = 2ab\\). This identity simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure precise arithmetic calculations, especially when squaring numbers and performing multiplications. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n3. **Use of Algebraic Identities:** Utilize algebraic identities to simplify expressions before performing calculations. This approach often reduces the complexity and potential for error.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing calculations, double-check each step to ensure accuracy. This includes verifying the application of algebraic identities and the correctness of arithmetic operations.\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Pitfalls:** Be aware of common pitfalls such as misapplying algebraic identities or making simple arithmetic mistakes. Awareness of these pitfalls can help in avoiding them during the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
