{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perpendicular Lines:** Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. For a line in the form \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\), the slope is \\(-\frac{A}{B}\\).\n\n2. **Identifying Slopes:** Identify the slopes of both given lines. For the first line \\(x + 2y + 3 = 0\\), the slope is \\(-\frac{1}{2}\\). For the second line \\(ax + 2y + 3 = 0\\), the slope is \\(-\frac{a}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the condition for perpendicular lines, which is that the product of their slopes equals -1. Set up the equation \\(-\frac{1}{2} \times -\frac{a}{2} = 1\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(a\\):** Solve the resulting equation carefully to find the value of \\(a\\). Ensure that you perform the arithmetic correctly and isolate \\(a\\) accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by substituting the value of \\(a\\) back into the equations to confirm that the lines are indeed perpendicular.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
