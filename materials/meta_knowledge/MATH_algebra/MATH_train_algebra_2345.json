{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor = 6\\).\n\n2. **Interpreting the Equation:** Given \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{x} \\rfloor = 6\\), this means that \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is between 6 and 7 (inclusive of 6 but exclusive of 7), because the floor of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is 6.\n\n3. **Range of \\(x\\):** From the above interpretation, \\(6 \\leq \\sqrt{x} < 7\\). Squaring all parts of this inequality gives \\(36 \\leq x < 49\\).\n\n4. **Counting Integer Solutions:** The integer values of \\(x\\) that satisfy \\(36 \\leq x < 49\\) are all the integers from 36 to 48 inclusive. Count these values to find the total number of possible integer values for \\(x\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the range and the count of integers to ensure accuracy, as this step is crucial in avoiding off-by-one errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
