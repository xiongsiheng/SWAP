{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** When expanding expressions like \\(0.08(20 + n)\\), apply the distributive property correctly: \\(0.08 \times 20 + 0.08 \times n\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms (terms with the same variable) to simplify the equation. For example, combine \\(0.03n\\) and \\(0.08n\\).\n\n3. **Isolating the Variable:** To solve for \\(n\\), isolate \\(n\\) on one side of the equation. This typically involves subtracting or adding terms to both sides to eliminate constants or coefficients.\n\n4. **Division to Solve:** Once the equation is simplified to the form \\(an = b\\), divide both sides by \\(a\\) to solve for \\(n\\).\n\n5. **Checking the Solution:** Substitute the calculated value of \\(n\\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step helps ensure the solution is correct and catches any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese steps will help minimize mistakes while solving linear equations with decimals."}
