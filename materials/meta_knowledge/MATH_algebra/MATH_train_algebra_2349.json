{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** The inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) of \\( f(x) \\) is defined such that \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\). For a function \\( f(x) = \frac{1}{ax+b} \\), to find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), you need to solve \\( y = \frac{1}{ax+b} \\) for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Solving for the Inverse:** To find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), interchange \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the function \\( y = \frac{1}{ax+b} \\) and solve for \\( y \\). This will give you the inverse function.\n\n3. **Setting the Inverse to Zero:** Once you have \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), set it equal to zero to find the solutions. This involves solving an equation where the inverse function equals zero.\n\n4. **Careful Algebraic Manipulation:** When solving for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) or setting the inverse function to zero, be meticulous with algebraic manipulations to avoid errors, especially when dealing with fractions and constants.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the solutions, substitute them back into the original function \\( f(x) \\) to verify that they indeed satisfy the condition \\( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\). This step ensures that the solutions are correct and not the result of algebraic mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
