{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the number of y-intercepts for a parabola given in the form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation Form:** Recognize that the given equation \\( x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 \\) is a parabola that opens sideways because it is in the form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants.\n\n2. **Setting \\( x \\) to Zero:** To find the y-intercepts, set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\). This is because the y-intercepts occur where the graph crosses the y-axis, which is where \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** When you set \\( x = 0 \\), you get a quadratic equation in \\( y \\): \\( 0 = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 \\). The number of real solutions to this quadratic equation (which can be found using the quadratic formula \\( y = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\)) determines the number of y-intercepts.\n\n4. **Discriminant Analysis:** The discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\) of the quadratic equation \\( 0 = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 \\) helps determine the nature of the solutions. If \\( \\Delta > 0 \\), there are two distinct real solutions (two y-intercepts). If \\( \\Delta = 0 \\), there is one real solution (one y-intercept). If \\( \\Delta < 0 \\), there are no real solutions (no y-intercepts).\n\n5. **Calculating the Discriminant:** For the given equation, calculate \\( \\Delta = (-3)^2 - 4(2)(7) = 9 - 56 = -47 \\). Since \\( \\Delta < 0 \\), this confirms there are no real y-intercepts.\n\nBy following these steps and understanding the nature of quadratic equations and their discriminants, you can accurately determine the number of y-intercepts for a given parabola."}
