{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Isolating Variables:** Start by isolating the variable under the square root. This often involves moving constants to the other side of the equation.\n\n2. **Squaring Both Sides:** When you square both sides of an equation to eliminate the square root, you might introduce extraneous solutions. Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.\n\n3. **Fraction Manipulation:** Be careful when dealing with fractions, especially when multiplying or dividing both sides by a fraction. Ensure that you correctly handle the numerator and denominator.\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions:** After squaring both sides, simplify the resulting equation by combining like terms and isolating the variable.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
