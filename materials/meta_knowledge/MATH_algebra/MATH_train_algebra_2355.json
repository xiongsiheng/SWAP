{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving functions and square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** Accurately substitute the given value into the function. For example, when evaluating \\( f(2) \\), replace every \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) = x^2 + 2\\sqrt{x} \\) with 2.\n\n2. **Square Roots:** Be precise when calculating square roots. Remember that \\( \\sqrt{x} \\) is the positive square root of \\( x \\). For instance, \\( \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform arithmetic operations carefully, especially when combining terms that involve both squares and square roots. Ensure that you correctly handle the multiplication and addition of these terms.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions. This ensures that you perform multiplications and divisions before additions and subtractions.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each operation, double-check your calculations to catch any simple arithmetic errors.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate evaluation of the given function expression."}
