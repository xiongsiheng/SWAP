{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating a function at a specific value, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value correctly into the function. For example, if you need to find \\( f(-1) \\) for \\( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \\), replace every \\( x \\) with \\( -1 \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression. This means first handle exponents, then multiplication or division, and finally addition or subtraction.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially with negative numbers. For instance, \\((-1)^2 = 1\\) and \\(-2 \times -1 = 2\\).\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step to avoid errors. For example, after substituting \\( -1 \\) into \\( x^2 - 2x \\), calculate \\( (-1)^2 \\) and \\( -2(-1) \\) separately before combining the results.\n\n5. **Final Check:** Optionally, double-check your final answer by substituting it back into the function to ensure it matches the original expression.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating functions at specific values."}
