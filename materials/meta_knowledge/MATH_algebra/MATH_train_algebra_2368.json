{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying polynomials, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly by multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. This ensures all possible products are accounted for.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After distributing, combine like terms. This involves adding or subtracting coefficients of terms with the same variable and degree.\n\n3. **Order of Terms:** Arrange the terms in the final polynomial in decreasing order of their degrees to meet the problem's requirement.\n\n4. **Careful Multiplication:** Be meticulous during the multiplication of terms, especially when dealing with exponents, ensuring that you add exponents correctly according to the rules of exponents.\n\n5. **Final Review:** After combining like terms, review the polynomial to ensure no terms were omitted or incorrectly combined. This step helps catch any oversights.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying polynomials."}
