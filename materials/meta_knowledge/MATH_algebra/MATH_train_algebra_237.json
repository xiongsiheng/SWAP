{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Properties of Exponents:** Understand and apply the properties of exponents, such as \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Radicals:** Convert radicals to exponents to simplify calculations. For example, \\(\\sqrt[4]{16}\\) can be written as \\(16^{1/4}\\).\n\n3. **Prime Factorization:** Use prime factorization to simplify numbers under the radicals. For instance, 16 can be factored into \\(2^4\\), which simplifies \\(16^{1/4}\\) to \\(2\\).\n\n4. **Combining Exponents:** When multiplying terms with different bases but the same exponent, use the property \\(a^m \\cdot b^m = (ab)^m\\). For example, combining \\(2^{1/4} \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\cdot 2^{1/2}\\) involves adding the exponents.\n\n5. **Fractional Exponents:** Be comfortable with operations involving fractional exponents, including addition and multiplication of such exponents.\n\n6. **Final Check:** After simplifying, ensure that the result is a positive integer. This step confirms that all calculations were performed correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
