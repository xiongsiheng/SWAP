{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) for the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). In this case, \\(a = 10\\), \\(b = -m\\), and \\(c = 420\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant:** For the quadratic equation to have integral solutions, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be a perfect square. Calculate \\(m^2 - 4 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 420\\) and ensure it is a perfect square.\n\n3. **Finding Perfect Squares:** Identify the smallest value of \\(m\\) such that \\(m^2 - 1680\\) is a perfect square. This involves checking values of \\(m\\) incrementally and verifying if the result is a square of an integer.\n\n4. **Systematic Checking:** Start with small values of \\(m\\) and systematically check if the discriminant is a perfect square. This helps in finding the smallest positive \\(m\\) efficiently.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a candidate value for \\(m\\), verify that it indeed makes the discriminant a perfect square and that the quadratic equation has integral solutions. This step ensures the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
