{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the smallest possible real value of an expression like \\(x^2 + 8x\\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Quadratic Functions:** Recognize that \\(x^2 + 8x\\) is a quadratic expression. The general form of a quadratic function is \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants.\n\n2. **Vertex of a Parabola:** The minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) occurs at the vertex. For a parabola that opens upwards (when \\(a > 0\\)), the vertex gives the minimum value.\n\n3. **Vertex Formula:** The x-coordinate of the vertex for \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) is given by \\(-\frac{b}{2a}\\). In this case, \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 8\\), so the x-coordinate of the vertex is \\(-\frac{8}{2 \\cdot 1} = -4\\).\n\n4. **Substituting to Find the Minimum Value:** Substitute the x-coordinate of the vertex back into the original expression to find the minimum value. For \\(x^2 + 8x\\), substituting \\(x = -4\\) gives \\((-4)^2 + 8(-4) = 16 - 32 = -16\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations to ensure that the substitution and arithmetic are correct. This step is crucial to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the smallest possible real value of the given quadratic expression."}
