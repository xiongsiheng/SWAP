{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For \\( f(g(x)) \\), substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\). In this case, \\( f(g(1)) \\) means you need to find \\( g(1) \\) first and then substitute that value into \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values into functions, ensure you substitute accurately. For example, if \\( g(x) = Bx \\), then \\( g(1) = B \\cdot 1 = B \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** When solving for a variable in terms of another, isolate the desired variable on one side of the equation. For instance, if you have \\( Ax - 2B^2 = 0 \\), rearrange it to solve for \\( A \\) in terms of \\( B \\).\n\n4. **Check for Non-Zero Conditions:** Be mindful of conditions given in the problem, such as \\( B \neq 0 \\). This ensures you do not divide by zero or make incorrect assumptions about the values.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the expression for \\( A \\) in terms of \\( B \\), substitute back into the original function composition to verify that \\( f(g(1)) = 0 \\) holds True. This step helps confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
