{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:** Look for any common factors in each term of the expression. In this case, both terms have a common factor of 37.\n\n2. **Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF):** Once you identify the GCF, factor it out from each term. For example, in $37a^2 + 111a$, you can factor out 37a.\n\n3. **Check Your Work:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure they correctly reproduce the original expression. This step helps verify that your factoring is accurate.\n\n4. **Simplify Each Term:** Ensure that each term is simplified to its most basic form after factoring out the GCF.\n\n5. **Consistency in Notation:** Use consistent notation and parentheses correctly to avoid confusion and errors in your factored form.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate factoring of expressions."}
