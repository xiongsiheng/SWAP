{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Formulate the Equation:** Translate the problem into a mathematical equation. In this case, you need to find an integer \\( x \\) such that \\( x^2 = 2x + 48 \\). This involves setting up the equation correctly based on the problem's description.\n\n2. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). Use methods like factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** When solving quadratic equations, especially those involving transformations of the variable, ensure that the solutions satisfy the original problem's conditions. Not all solutions of the quadratic equation may be valid for the original problem.\n\n4. **Identify the Least Integer:** Once you have the solutions, determine which one is the least integer. This step involves comparing the integer values and selecting the smallest one.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the solutions back into the original problem to confirm that they meet the conditions specified. This step helps in identifying any errors made during the solving process.\n\nThese guidelines will help in accurately solving the problem and minimizing errors."}
