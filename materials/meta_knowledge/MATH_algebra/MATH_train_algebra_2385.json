{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving cube roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Use of Conjugates:** Unlike square roots, cube roots require a different approach. Instead of conjugates, use the properties of cube roots to simplify. For example, recognize that \\(\\sqrt[3]{16} = 2\\sqrt[3]{2}\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication by Suitable Forms:** To eliminate cube roots in the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by a suitable form of 1 that will result in a perfect cube in the denominator. This often involves expressions like \\(\\sqrt[3]{2^2} - \\sqrt[3]{2} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4} + \\sqrt[3]{4^2}\\) for the given problem.\n\n3. **Understanding Cube Roots:** Be proficient with the properties of cube roots, such as \\(\\sqrt[3]{a} \\cdot \\(\\sqrt[3]{a})^2 = a\\), which can help in simplifying expressions.\n\n4. **Careful Multiplication:** When multiplying expressions involving cube roots, ensure that each term in the numerator and denominator is multiplied correctly to avoid algebraic errors.\n\n5. **Simplification Steps:** After rationalizing, simplify the resulting expression step by step, ensuring that each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
