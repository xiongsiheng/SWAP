{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection of two lines, consider the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you are dealing with a system of linear equations. The goal is to find a common solution (x, y) that satisfies both equations.\n\n2. **Elimination or Substitution:** Choose a method (elimination or substitution) to solve the system. For elimination, multiply equations to align coefficients for a variable, then subtract or add to eliminate one variable. For substitution, solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other equation.\n\n3. **Careful Arithmetic:** Perform all arithmetic operations carefully, especially when dealing with fractions or large numbers, as these can introduce calculation errors.\n\n4. **Check Your Solution:** Once you find the values of x and y, substitute them back into both original equations to verify that they satisfy both equations. This step ensures that your solution is correct and not the result of an arithmetic mistake.\n\n5. **Order of Coordinates:** When writing the ordered pair (x, y), ensure that the x-coordinate is listed first and the y-coordinate second. This is a common convention and ensures clarity in your answer.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate results when finding the intersection of two lines."}
