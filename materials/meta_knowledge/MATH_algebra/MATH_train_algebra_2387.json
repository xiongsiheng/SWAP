{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of the squares of the solutions of a quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Remember the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) for solving \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Sum and Product of Roots:** Use the relationships \\( \\alpha + \\beta = -b/a \\) and \\( \\alpha \\beta = c/a \\) where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are the roots of the quadratic equation.\n\n3. **Sum of Squares of Roots:** To find \\(\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2\\), use the identity \\(\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = (\\alpha + \\beta)^2 - 2\\alpha\\beta\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure accurate arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the application of formulas to avoid common mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
