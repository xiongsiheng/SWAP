{"Knowledge": "To solve this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Averages:** The average (mean) of a set of numbers is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers. In this context, the average age of the female members and male members are given.\n\n2. **Weighted Averages:** When combining averages from two different groups, the overall average is a weighted average, influenced by the number of individuals in each group. The formula for weighted average can be used to relate the averages of the subgroups to the overall average.\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the information given to set up equations that relate the total sum of ages for females and males to the total number of members. This involves understanding that the total sum of ages divided by the total number of members equals the overall average age.\n\n4. **Solving for Ratios:** Once equations are set up, solve for the ratio of female to male members by isolating the variables representing the number of members in each group and simplifying the resulting expressions.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with averages and ratios, as errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nThese points should help in accurately determining the ratio of female to male members in the survey."}
