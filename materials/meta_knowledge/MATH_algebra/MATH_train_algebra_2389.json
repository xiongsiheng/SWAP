{"Knowledge": "To determine the integer closest to the cube root of a number, consider the following:\n\n1. **Cube Roots of Small Integers:** Memorize or quickly calculate the cubes of small integers (e.g., \\(1^3 = 1\\), \\(2^3 = 8\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(4^3 = 64\\), \\(5^3 = 125\\), etc.). This helps in identifying the range where the cube root lies.\n\n2. **Estimation:** Estimate the cube root by comparing the given number to the known cubes. For example, if the number is between two known cubes, the cube root will be between the corresponding integers.\n\n3. **Interpolation:** If the number is not close to any known cube, use interpolation to approximate the cube root. This involves finding the midpoint between two known cubes and determining which is closer.\n\n4. **Calculators:** If allowed, use a calculator to find the cube root and round to the nearest integer. Ensure the calculator's settings are correct to avoid errors in calculation.\n\n5. **Consistency:** Always verify your answer by cubing the chosen integer and checking if the result is close to the original number. This step helps in confirming the accuracy of your estimation.\n\nThese strategies will aid in accurately finding the integer closest to the cube root of a given number."}
