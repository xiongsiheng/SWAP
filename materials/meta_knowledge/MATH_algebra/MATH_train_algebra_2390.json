{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding and Simplifying:** When dealing with products of binomials, expand them correctly using the distributive property or the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last). Ensure that each term is multiplied by every other term in the other binomial.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms on both sides of the equation. This step is crucial to simplify the equation and make it easier to solve.\n\n3. **Rearranging the Equation:** Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero. This helps in identifying the roots of the equation using factorization or the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Factoring Quadratics:** If the equation is quadratic (degree 2), try to factor it into the product of two binomials. Look for common factors and pairs of numbers that multiply to the constant term and add to the coefficient of the x term.\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential solutions by factoring or using the quadratic formula, substitute them back into the original equation to verify they satisfy the equation. This step ensures that no extraneous solutions are included.\n\n6. **Understanding Extraneous Solutions:** Be aware that some solutions obtained might not satisfy the original equation due to the nature of algebraic manipulations, especially when squaring or multiplying both sides. These are called extraneous solutions and should be discarded.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
