{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Age Difference:** The age difference between Marika and her father remains constant over time. This is a key factor in solving the problem.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given information to set up equations that represent the ages at different times. For example, if Marika's age is \\( x \\) and her father's age is \\( 4x \\) in 2004, you can use these relationships to find future ages.\n\n3. **Linear Relationships:** Recognize that the relationship between their ages is linear. This means you can use simple algebraic methods to find when the father's age will be three times Marika's age.\n\n4. **Calculating Future Years:** Once you determine the ages at which the father's age is three times Marika's age, calculate the corresponding year by adding the necessary number of years to 2004.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by checking if the ages match the required relationship in the calculated year. This step ensures accuracy and helps catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
