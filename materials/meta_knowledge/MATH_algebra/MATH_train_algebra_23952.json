{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Time Conversion:** Ensure accurate conversion between different units of time. For example, 1 hour equals 60 minutes, and 1 minute equals 60 seconds.\n\n2. **Rate Calculation:** Understand that the rate of travel (miles per hour) is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. In this case, the rate is given in miles per minute and seconds.\n\n3. **Consistency in Units:** When calculating, make sure all units are consistent. Convert all times to either minutes or seconds to simplify the calculation.\n\n4. **Multiplication for Total Distance:** Once you have the rate in miles per hour, multiply this rate by the number of hours to find the total distance traveled.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations for simple arithmetic errors, especially when converting units and multiplying rates.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving rates and time conversions."}
