{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the distance between two points, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula correctly: \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n2. **Coordinate Subtraction:** Ensure that you subtract the coordinates correctly. For example, \\(x_2 - x_1\\) should be \\(-1 - 2\\) and \\(y_2 - y_1\\) should be \\(-1 - 2\\).\n\n3. **Squaring Differences:** Square the differences of the coordinates accurately. For example, \\((-1 - 2)^2\\) is \\((-3)^2\\) which equals \\(9\\).\n\n4. **Adding Squares:** Add the squared differences correctly. For example, \\(9 + 9\\) equals \\(18\\).\n\n5. **Taking the Square Root:** Finally, take the square root of the sum of the squares correctly. For example, \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) simplifies to \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThese steps ensure accuracy in calculating the distance between two points."}
