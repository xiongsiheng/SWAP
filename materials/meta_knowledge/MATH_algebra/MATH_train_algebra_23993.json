{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operator:** Clearly understand the definition of the operator \\(\\oslash\\). In this case, \\(a \\oslash b = (\\sqrt{2a + b})^3\\). Ensure you apply this definition correctly.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Substitute the given values into the operator to form an equation. Here, \\(4 \\oslash x = 27\\) translates to \\((\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 4 + x})^3 = 27\\).\n\n3. **Solving for the Unknown:** Isolate the unknown variable by simplifying the equation step by step. Remember to handle the cube and square root operations carefully.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with roots and powers, as these operations can easily lead to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the found value of \\(x\\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving the problem."}
