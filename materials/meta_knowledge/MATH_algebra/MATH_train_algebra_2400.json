{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( c \\) in a quadratic equation with given roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall that the roots of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) are given by \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the given quadratic.\n\n2. **Matching Formulas:** Compare the given roots \\( x = \frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{c}}{2} \\) with the standard quadratic formula. This comparison should help you identify the correct value of \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the quadratic formula's discriminant (\\( b^2 - 4ac \\)) matches the expression under the square root in the given roots. This will confirm the correct value of \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when squaring or multiplying coefficients, as these steps are crucial for finding \\( c \\) accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you calculate \\( c \\), substitute it back into the quadratic equation to verify that the roots match the given form. This step will help catch any errors in your calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( c \\) in such problems."}
