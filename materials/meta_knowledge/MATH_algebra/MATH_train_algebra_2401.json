{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Forms:** Recognize that \\( \frac{1}{25} \\) can be rewritten as \\( 5^{-2} \\). This equivalence is crucial for setting up the equation correctly.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When the bases are the same, you can equate the exponents. For example, if \\( 5^{x} = 5^{y} \\), then \\( x = y \\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Once you have a linear equation in terms of \\( n \\), solve it carefully, ensuring you correctly isolate \\( n \\) and simplify any fractions.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with negative exponents or when simplifying expressions.\n\n5. **Expressing Answers Clearly:** Ensure that your final answer is expressed as a common fraction, as requested in the problem. This includes simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms if necessary.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
