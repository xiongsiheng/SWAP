{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Clearly define variables for each number and set up equations based on the given conditions. For example, if the numbers are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) with \\(a < b < c\\), you might write equations like \\(a + b + c = 67\\), \\(c - b = 7\\), and \\(b - a = 3\\).\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Solve the system of equations step by step, ensuring that each step logically follows from the previous one. Use substitution or elimination methods to find the values of the variables.\n\n3. **Checking Constraints:** Ensure that the numbers you find are different and satisfy all given conditions. This includes checking the differences between the numbers and that their sum equals 67.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding, subtracting, or multiplying integers, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find the values of the numbers, verify by substituting them back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy all the given constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
