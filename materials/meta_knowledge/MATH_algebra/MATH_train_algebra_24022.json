{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Variables:** Clearly define and understand the variables involved. In this case, \\( w \\) represents the number of widgets produced per hour, and \\( t \\) represents the number of hours worked.\n\n2. **Formulating Expressions:** Write down the expressions for the total number of widgets produced on each day. On Monday, it is \\( w \times t \\), and on Tuesday, it is \\( (w + 4) \times (t - 2) \\).\n\n3. **Substitution:** Substitute the given relationship between \\( w \\) and \\( t \\) into the expressions. Here, \\( w = 2t \\) should be substituted into both expressions.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the expressions carefully, ensuring that you handle the multiplication and subtraction correctly. Pay attention to the distribution of terms.\n\n5. **Comparison:** Calculate the difference between the number of widgets produced on Monday and Tuesday by subtracting the Tuesday expression from the Monday expression.\n\n6. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy. Small errors in calculations can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
