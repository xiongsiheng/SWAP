{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Identity:** Recognize that the given equation is related to the identity for the sum of cubes. Specifically, \\((a + b + c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)\\). This identity can simplify the problem significantly.\n\n2. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are positive integers, the factors on the right-hand side of the identity must also be integers. This constraint can help in narrowing down possible values.\n\n3. **Factorization:** Be meticulous when factoring and simplifying expressions. Ensure that each step maintains the equality of the equation.\n\n4. **Checking Possible Values:** Given the specific value on the right-hand side (150), consider the possible factorizations of 150 in the context of the identity. This involves checking combinations of \\(a + b\\), \\(b + c\\), and \\(c + a\\) that multiply to 150.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once a solution is found, verify it by substituting back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
