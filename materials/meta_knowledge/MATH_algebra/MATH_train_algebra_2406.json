{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating functions and performing algebraic operations, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** When evaluating a function at a specific value, substitute the value directly into the function and perform the arithmetic carefully. For example, to find \\( f(3) \\), replace \\( x \\) with 3 in the function \\( f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 9 \\).\n\n2. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform all arithmetic operations accurately. This includes squaring numbers, multiplying coefficients, and adding or subtracting terms. Small arithmetic errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n3. **Handling Negative Values:** Be cautious when substituting negative values into the function. For example, when evaluating \\( f(-3) \\), remember to apply the negative sign correctly to all terms involving \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Combining Results:** After evaluating the function at different points, combine the results as specified in the problem. In this case, multiply the evaluated results by the given coefficients and then add them together.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After completing the calculations, double-check each step to ensure there are no mistakes. This includes verifying the substitution, arithmetic operations, and the final combination of results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating functions and performing algebraic operations."}
