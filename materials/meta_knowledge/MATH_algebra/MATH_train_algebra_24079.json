{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope of a Line:** Recall that the slope of a line passing through points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\).\n\n2. **Parallel Lines:** Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. Therefore, you need to find the slope of the given line and ensure the line through the points has the same slope.\n\n3. **Equation of a Line:** Convert the given line equation \\(2x + 3y = 21\\) to the slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\) to identify the slope \\(m\\).\n\n4. **Substitution and Solving:** Once you have the slope, use it to set up an equation for the line through the points \\((2, -9)\\) and \\((j, 17)\\), then solve for \\(j\\).\n\n5. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to ensure accuracy, as errors in calculations can lead to incorrect values for \\(j\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
