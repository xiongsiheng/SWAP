{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Analyzing Piecewise Functions:** Understand that piecewise functions have different definitions for different intervals of \\(x\\). You must consider each piece separately.\n\n2. **Setting Each Piece to Zero:** For each piece of the function, set the expression equal to zero and solve for \\(x\\). Ensure you check that the solution falls within the correct interval for that piece.\n\n3. **Checking Interval Validity:** After solving for \\(x\\) in each piece, verify that the value of \\(x\\) lies within the specified interval for that piece of the function. Solutions outside the valid interval are not valid.\n\n4. **Summing Solutions:** If you find multiple solutions, sum them up only if they are valid according to the function's definition. Invalid solutions should be excluded from the sum.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Solutions:** Substitute your solutions back into the original function to ensure they satisfy \\(f(x) = 0\\). This step helps verify the correctness of your solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
