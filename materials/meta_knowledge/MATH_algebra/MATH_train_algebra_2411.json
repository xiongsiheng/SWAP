{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the number of real solutions for this type of equation, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Values:** Remember that the absolute value function, \\(|x|\\), always returns a non-negative value. This property can help in analyzing the feasibility of solutions.\n\n2. **Analyzing Quadratic Expressions:** When dealing with quadratic expressions like \\((x - 5x + 12)^2\\), understand that squaring any real number results in a non-negative value. This can be crucial in determining the range of possible values for the equation.\n\n3. **Combining Conditions:** Combine the conditions from the absolute value and the quadratic expression to see if there are any values of \\(x\\) that satisfy both parts of the equation simultaneously.\n\n4. **Checking for Feasibility:** Since the equation includes a term that is always non-negative (\\((x - 5x + 12)^2 + 1\\)) being equal to another term that is non-positive (\\(-|x|\\)), this immediately suggests that no real \\(x\\) can satisfy the equation.\n\n5. **Logical Reasoning:** Use logical reasoning to conclude that if a term is always greater than or equal to 1, it cannot be equal to a term that is less than or equal to 0. This logical approach helps in quickly determining the absence of real solutions.\n\nThese insights should aid in accurately determining the number of real solutions for such equations."}
