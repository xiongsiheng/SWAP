{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rate of Work:** Understand that the rate at which each hose fills the pool is inversely proportional to the time it takes to fill the pool alone. For example, if hose A takes \\( t_A \\) hours to fill the pool, its rate is \\( \frac{1}{t_A} \\) of the pool per hour.\n\n2. **Combining Rates:** When two hoses work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates. For example, if hoses A and B together take 4 hours to fill the pool, their combined rate is \\( \frac{1}{4} \\) of the pool per hour.\n\n3. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the given information about the combined rates of different pairs of hoses. Solve this system to find the individual rates of each hose.\n\n4. **Final Combined Rate:** Once you have the individual rates, sum them to find the combined rate of all three hoses working together. The time taken by all three hoses together is the reciprocal of this combined rate.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and reciprocals, to avoid errors in the final answer.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking if the calculated times for different combinations of hoses are consistent with the given information.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
