{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value of \\( x \\) correctly into the expression. Double-check that you have not missed any part of the expression or added incorrect terms.\n\n2. **Simplification Steps:** After substitution, simplify the expression step by step. Pay attention to signs and operations, especially when dealing with subtraction and addition.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with arithmetic operations. Errors often occur in simple addition or subtraction, so double-check these calculations.\n\n4. **Consistency in Notation:** Use consistent notation and be clear about what you are substituting and simplifying to avoid confusion.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your final answer by substituting the simplified result back into the original expression to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in evaluating such expressions."}
