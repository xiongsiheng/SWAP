{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sum of Integers:** Recognize that the sum \\(1 + 2 + \\cdots + n\\) is given by the formula \\(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\). This formula is crucial for simplifying the problem.\n\n2. **Divisibility Rules:** Apply basic divisibility rules to quickly check conditions. For example, understanding when \\(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\) divides \\(6n\\) involves checking factors and common divisors.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning:** Use logical reasoning to narrow down possible values of \\(n\\). Consider how the factors of \\(6n\\) relate to the factors of \\(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Systematic Checking:** If necessary, systematically check small values of \\(n\\) to see if they satisfy the condition. This can provide insights into a general pattern or solution.\n\n5. **Verification:** After identifying potential values of \\(n\\), verify each one by substituting back into the original condition to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
