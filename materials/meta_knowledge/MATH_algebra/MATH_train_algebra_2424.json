{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) which can be used to find the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Sum and Product of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(x_1 + x_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the roots \\(x_1 x_2 = \\frac{c}{a}\\). In your problem, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -m\\), and \\(c = 24\\), so \\(x_1 + x_2 = m\\) and \\(x_1 x_2 = 24\\).\n\n3. **Integer Factorization:** Since \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are integers, you need to find pairs of integers whose product is 24. List all pairs of integer factors of 24 and calculate their sums to determine possible values of \\(m\\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Duplicates:** Ensure that you count each distinct value of \\(m\\) only once, as some pairs of factors may yield the same sum.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify each potential value of \\(m\\) by substituting it back into the quadratic equation to ensure it produces integer roots.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
