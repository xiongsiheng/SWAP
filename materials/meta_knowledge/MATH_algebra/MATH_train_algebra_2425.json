{"Knowledge": "To determine the largest value of \\( x \\) for which the expression \\(\\dfrac{x+1}{8x^2-65x+8}\\) is not defined, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Denominator**: The expression is undefined when the denominator is zero. Therefore, you need to solve the equation \\( 8x^2 - 65x + 8 = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations**: Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 8 \\), \\( b = -65 \\), and \\( c = 8 \\), to find the roots of the equation.\n\n3. **Calculating Roots**: Calculate the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\) and then find the values of \\( x \\). The largest root will be the value of \\( x \\) that makes the expression undefined.\n\n4. **Checking Roots**: Ensure that the roots calculated are correct by verifying that substituting these values into the original quadratic equation results in zero.\n\n5. **Final Verification**: Once you have the roots, confirm that the largest root indeed makes the denominator zero and thus the expression undefined.\n\nThese steps will help you accurately determine the largest value of \\( x \\) for which the expression is not defined."}
