{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Costs:** Break down the total cost into its components: the cost of the shirts, the entrance fee, and the sales tax.\n\n2. **Sales Tax Calculation:** Remember that sales tax is calculated on the price of each item and is a percentage of that price. For example, a 5% sales tax on an item priced at $x would be $0.05x$.\n\n3. **Budget Constraints:** Ensure that the total amount spent does not exceed the available budget. This includes all costs: the entrance fee, the cost of the shirts, and the sales tax.\n\n4. **Whole-Dollar Amounts:** Since the price of each shirt is a whole-dollar amount, the solution must be an integer.\n\n5. **Inequality Setup:** Use an inequality to represent the total cost, ensuring that it is less than or equal to the available budget.\n\n6. **Solving for Maximum Price:** When solving for the maximum price, round down to the nearest whole number to ensure the budget is not exceeded.\n\n7. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations by summing up the entrance fee, the total cost of the shirts, and the total sales tax to ensure it fits within the budget.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
