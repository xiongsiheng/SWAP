{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution of Coordinates:** When given the coordinates of the intersection point, substitute these coordinates into both line equations to form a system of equations. This ensures that the point lies on both lines.\n\n2. **Solving for Variables:** When solving for a variable like \\( k \\), ensure that you isolate \\( k \\) correctly. This involves careful handling of algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with negative numbers or when simplifying expressions, to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Consistency of Equations:** Ensure that the equations are consistent with the given information. For example, the slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\) should correctly represent the lines as described in the problem.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the value of \\( k \\), substitute it back into the line equation for line \\( n \\) and verify that the intersection point satisfies both equations. This step confirms the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
