{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that function composition involves applying one function to the result of another. In this case, you need to find \\( g(-5) \\) first, then use that result as the input for \\( f \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating expressions. For \\( g(x) = 5x + 2x^2 \\), you should square \\( x \\) before multiplying by 2, and then add the result to \\( 5x \\).\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, be precise. For example, substituting \\(-5\\) into \\( g(x) \\) means calculating \\( 5(-5) + 2(-5)^2 \\).\n\n4. **Negative Numbers:** Be cautious with operations involving negative numbers, especially when squaring or multiplying, to avoid sign errors.\n\n5. **Simplification:** After substituting, simplify the expression step by step, ensuring each operation is correct before moving on to the next.\n\n6. **Final Verification:** Once you have the final answer, consider re-evaluating the entire expression from scratch to verify your result, as this can catch any oversights or calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
