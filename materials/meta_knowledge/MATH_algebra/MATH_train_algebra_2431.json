{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation \\(\\star\\). In this case, \\(A \\star B = \\frac{(A + B)}{3}\\). This means you need to add the two numbers and then divide by 3.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply the operation \\(\\star\\) step by step, starting with the innermost pair of numbers and moving outward. This ensures that you correctly chain the operations together.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic calculations, especially when dealing with fractions. Errors in addition or division can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each step of the calculation, double-check your work to ensure accuracy. This includes verifying additions and divisions.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have the final answer, consider performing the entire calculation again from scratch to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
