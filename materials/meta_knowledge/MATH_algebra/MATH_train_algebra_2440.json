{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Ensure that you correctly handle algebraic manipulations, such as moving terms from one side of the equation to the other, and changing signs appropriately.\n\n2. **Quadratic Equations:** When solving quadratic equations, remember the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) or the method of factoring, if possible. Check for real solutions and ensure they satisfy the original equation.\n\n3. **Substitution:** After finding the value of \\(x\\), substitute it back into the expression \\((10x - 3)^2\\) to verify the calculation. This step is crucial to ensure the correctness of the final answer.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with squares and square roots, as these can lead to computational errors.\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify your solution by substituting the value of \\(x\\) back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
