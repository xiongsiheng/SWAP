{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given information to set up a system of equations. In this case, you have two variables (the time spent at each speed) and two pieces of information (total distance and total time).\n\n2. **Using Rate-Time-Distance Formula:** Recall that distance equals rate multiplied by time (D = RT). This formula will help you relate the speeds and times to the total distance traveled.\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When solving for two variables, ensure you correctly isolate one variable and substitute or use elimination methods accurately.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic, especially when dealing with fractions and mixed numbers, as these can be prone to calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verifying Solutions:** Once you have your answer, verify that it makes sense within the context of the problem. For example, check that the sum of the times equals the total time given and that the calculated distances match the speeds and times.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
