{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating logarithmic expressions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Properties of Logarithms:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as the power rule (\\(\\log_b(a^c) = c\\log_b(a)\\)), the product rule (\\(\\log_b(xy) = \\log_b(x) + \\log_b(y)\\)), and the quotient rule (\\(\\log_b\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right) = \\log_b(x) - \\log_b(y)\\)).\n\n2. **Simplifying Logarithms:** Simplify the arguments of the logarithms before applying the properties. For example, recognize that \\(81 = 3^4\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{9} = 3^{-2}\\).\n\n3. **Common Bases:** Be aware of common bases and their powers, especially base 3, which is used in this problem.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with exponents and fractions.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After simplifying, ensure that the final expression is correct by verifying it with a calculator or through logical reasoning.\n\nThese guidelines will help you minimize errors when working with logarithmic expressions."}
