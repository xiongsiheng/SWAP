{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Quadratics:** When factoring quadratic expressions like \\(x^2 + 15x + 54\\), look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (54) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (15). Similarly, for \\(x^2 - 17x + 72\\), find two numbers that multiply to 72 and add up to -17.\n\n2. **Matching Factors:** Ensure that the factors match the given forms \\((x + a)(x + b)\\) and \\((x - b)(x - c)\\). This means identifying \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly from the factored forms.\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are integers, use this constraint to verify your choices during factoring. Incorrect integer pairs will not satisfy both the product and sum conditions.\n\n4. **Sum Calculation:** After determining \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), carefully add them together to find \\(a + b + c\\). A common mistake is to overlook the signs of the integers when summing.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can expand the factored forms back to their original quadratic expressions to ensure they match the given expressions, which helps confirm the correctness of your factoring.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
