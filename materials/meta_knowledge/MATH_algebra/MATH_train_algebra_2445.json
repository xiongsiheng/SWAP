{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Means:** Recall the definitions of arithmetic mean and geometric mean. The arithmetic mean of two numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is given by \\(\frac{x + y}{2}\\), and the geometric mean is given by \\(\\sqrt{xy}\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given means to set up equations. For example, if the arithmetic mean is 18, then \\(\frac{x + y}{2} = 18\\), which simplifies to \\(x + y = 36\\). If the geometric mean is \\(\\sqrt{92}\\), then \\(\\sqrt{xy} = \\sqrt{92}\\), which simplifies to \\(xy = 92\\).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Solve the system of equations \\(x + y = 36\\) and \\(xy = 92\\) to find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This can be done by expressing one variable in terms of the other and substituting.\n\n4. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Utilize algebraic identities to express \\(x^2 + y^2\\) in terms of \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\). Recall that \\((x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\\), so \\(x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are done accurately, especially when squaring numbers and multiplying them. Small errors in these steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you have calculated \\(x^2 + y^2\\), verify that the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) obtained from the equations satisfy the original conditions of the arithmetic and geometric means.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
