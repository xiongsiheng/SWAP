{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the value of \\( x \\) correctly into the expression, replacing every instance of \\( x \\) with the given value.\n\n2. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Follow the correct order of operations: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This ensures that you perform operations in the correct sequence.\n\n3. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses/brackets and moving outward. This helps in avoiding mistakes in complex expressions.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers or exponents, as these can be error-prone areas.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After obtaining the final answer, it can be helpful to re-evaluate the expression quickly to ensure that no mistakes were made during the simplification process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
