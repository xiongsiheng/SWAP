{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Complex Numbers in Polar Form:** Convert complex numbers to polar form to simplify exponentiation. For a complex number \\( z = re^{i\theta} \\), \\( z^n = r^n e^{in\theta} \\).\n\n2. **De Moivre's Theorem:** Use De Moivre's Theorem, which states \\( (r(\\cos \theta + i \\sin \theta))^n = r^n (\\cos(n\theta) + i \\sin(n\theta)) \\), to raise complex numbers to integer powers.\n\n3. **Simplifying Radicals:** When dealing with square roots of complex numbers, ensure you correctly identify the magnitude and argument. For \\( \frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), the magnitude is 1 and the argument is \\( \frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n\n4. **Modulo Operations:** Use modulo operations to simplify large exponents. For example, \\( e^{i\theta} \\) cycles every \\( 2\\pi \\), so \\( e^{i(2\\pi k + \theta)} = e^{i\theta} \\) for any integer \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to calculations involving angles and magnitudes, as errors in these can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
