{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining where the inverse function of a given function is undefined, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** The inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) essentially reverses the operations of \\(f(x)\\). For \\(f(x) = \\frac{x-3}{x-4}\\), the inverse function will involve swapping the roles of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and solving for \\(y\\).\n\n2. **Domain of the Inverse:** The domain of \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) is the range of \\(f(x)\\). To find where \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) is undefined, identify the values of \\(x\\) that make the denominator of \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) zero.\n\n3. **Identifying Undefined Points:** For \\(f(x) = \\frac{x-3}{x-4}\\), the inverse function will have a denominator that includes \\(x-4\\). Therefore, \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x = 4\\), as this makes the denominator zero.\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check by ensuring that \\(x = 4\\) is indeed the value that makes the denominator of the inverse function zero, and confirm that this value is not in the domain of \\(f^{-1}(x)\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes in determining where the inverse function is undefined."}
