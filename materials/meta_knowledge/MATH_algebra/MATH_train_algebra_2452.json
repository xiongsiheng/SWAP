{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in a quadratic equation given specific conditions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Parabola:** Recall that the vertex form of a parabola with a vertical axis of symmetry is \\(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. For this problem, the vertex is \\((3, 2)\\), so the equation can be written as \\(y = a(x - 3)^2 + 2\\).\n\n2. **Substitution of Points:** Use the given point \\((1, 0)\\) to find the value of \\(a\\). Substitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 0\\) into the vertex form equation to solve for \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Conversion to Standard Form:** Once \\(a\\) is determined, convert the vertex form equation \\(y = a(x - 3)^2 + 2\\) back to the standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) by expanding and simplifying.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all algebraic manipulations are correct, especially when expanding and simplifying the quadratic expression. Missteps here can lead to incorrect coefficients.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the given point \\((1, 0)\\) back into the standard form equation to verify that the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are correct. This step confirms that the equation fits all given conditions.\n\nThese steps should help minimize errors and ensure accurate determination of the coefficients in the quadratic equation."}
