{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Substitution:** When given a function in terms of a variable (like \\( g(2x - 5) \\)), substitute the desired value into the expression inside the function to find the corresponding \\( x \\) value.\n\n2. **Solving for \\( x \\):** After substituting the given value into the function's argument, solve the resulting equation to find the specific \\( x \\) that makes the argument equal to the given value.\n\n3. **Substitute \\( x \\) into the Function:** Once you have the \\( x \\) value, substitute this \\( x \\) back into the original function definition (like \\( 3x + 9 \\)) to find the function value at the given point.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for both solving the equation and substituting back into the function to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the steps you take are consistent with the function's definition and the operations involved, as inconsistencies can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
