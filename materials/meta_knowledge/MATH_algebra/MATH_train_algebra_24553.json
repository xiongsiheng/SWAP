{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recognize that an arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive terms. In this case, the common difference is 2.\n\n2. **Sum of Cubes Formula:** Be familiar with the formula for the sum of cubes of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence. For a sequence starting at \\( a \\) with a common difference \\( d \\), the sum of cubes can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\( x \\) is an integer, ensure that all calculations respect this constraint. This includes checking that any derived values of \\( x \\) and \\( n \\) are integers.\n\n4. **Solving for \\( n \\):** When solving for \\( n \\), use algebraic techniques to isolate \\( n \\) and ensure that the solution satisfies the condition \\( n > 3 \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding a potential value for \\( n \\), verify by substituting back into the original problem to ensure the sum of cubes equals -1197.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
