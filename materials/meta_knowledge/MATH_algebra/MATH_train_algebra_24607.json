{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factorization:** Ensure that you factorize both the numerator and the denominator correctly. This includes recognizing common factors and quadratic expressions that can be factored.\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** When simplifying fractions, make sure to cancel factors that are common to both the numerator and the denominator. Be cautious not to cancel terms that are part of a sum or difference.\n\n3. **Identifying Restrictions:** Be aware of values of \\( r \\) that make the denominator zero, as these values are not permissible solutions to the equation.\n\n4. **Equating Numerators:** After ensuring the denominators are the same, equate the numerators to solve for \\( r \\). This step requires careful algebraic manipulation.\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
