{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** Ratios represent the relative sizes of parts in a whole. In this case, the integers are in the ratio 1:3:4, meaning for every one part of the first integer, there are three parts of the second integer and four parts of the third integer.\n\n2. **Sum of Parts:** Since the integers are in a specific ratio, you can represent them as \\(x\\), \\(3x\\), and \\(4x\\), where \\(x\\) is a common multiplier. The sum of these integers is \\(x + 3x + 4x = 8x\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\):** Given the sum of the integers (72), set up the equation \\(8x = 72\\) and solve for \\(x\\). This will give you the value of the smallest integer since \\(x\\) represents the smallest part of the ratio.\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding \\(x\\), verify by calculating \\(3x\\) and \\(4x\\) to ensure their sum equals 72, confirming the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving problems involving ratios and sums of integers."}
