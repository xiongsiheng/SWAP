{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving custom operations like $\\Diamond$, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understand the Operation Definition:** Clearly understand and apply the definition of the operation exactly as given. In this case, $a\\Diamond b = ab^2 - b + 1$.\n\n2. **Substitute Correctly:** When substituting values into the operation, ensure that you substitute both $a$ and $b$ correctly and separately into the formula.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating the expression. This means squaring $b$ first, then multiplying by $a$, subtracting $b$, and finally adding 1.\n\n4. **Negative Numbers:** Be cautious when dealing with negative numbers, especially when squaring or multiplying, as these operations can change the sign of the result.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing the operations, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, as arithmetic errors are common in such problems.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving custom operations."}
