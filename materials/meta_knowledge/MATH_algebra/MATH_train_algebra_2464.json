{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating the Equation:** Recognize that the product of two consecutive integers can be expressed as \\( n(n + 1) = 506 \\), where \\( n \\) is the smaller integer.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Convert the equation into a standard quadratic form \\( n^2 + n - 506 = 0 \\) and solve it using methods like factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.\n\n3. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions for \\( n \\) are integers, as the problem specifies positive consecutive integers.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum:** Once you have identified the two consecutive integers, add them together to find their sum.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and verify that the product of the identified integers indeed equals 506. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
