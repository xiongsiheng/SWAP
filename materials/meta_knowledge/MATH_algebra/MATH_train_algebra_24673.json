{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Negative Exponents:** Remember that \\(a^{-n} = \\frac{1}{a^n}\\). This rule is crucial when dealing with negative exponents.\n\n2. **Fractional Exponents:** When you have a fraction raised to a power, apply the power to both the numerator and the denominator. For example, \\(\\left( \\frac{1}{a} \\right)^n = \\frac{1}{a^n}\\).\n\n3. **Multiplication of Powers:** When multiplying terms with the same base, add the exponents. For example, \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\).\n\n4. **Sign of Exponents:** Be cautious with the signs of exponents, especially when dealing with negative bases. For example, \\((-a)^n\\) depends on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd.\n\n5. **Simplification Steps:** Always simplify step by step, ensuring that each step is correct before moving on to the next. This helps in avoiding cumulative errors.\n\n6. **Final Check:** After simplifying, it's a good practice to review the expression to ensure that no steps were missed or misapplied.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying such expressions."}
