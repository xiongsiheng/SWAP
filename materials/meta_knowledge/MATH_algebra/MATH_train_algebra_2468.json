{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly set up your equations based on the given information. For example, if you have two variables (pounds of corn and pounds of beans), you need two equations to solve for both.\n\n2. **Converting Units:** Make sure all units are consistent. In this case, convert dollars to cents to avoid unit mismatch errors.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with decimals and fractions. Rounding errors can significantly affect the final answer.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations at each step to catch any mistakes early.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After solving for one variable, substitute it back into the other equation to find the second variable and verify that the total cost and weight match the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
