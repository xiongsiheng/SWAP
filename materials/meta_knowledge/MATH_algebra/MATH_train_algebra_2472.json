{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:** Recognize that the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) represents a circle centered at the origin with radius 1. This geometric interpretation can guide your algebraic manipulations.\n\n2. **Maximizing Linear Expressions:** When trying to maximize a linear expression like \\(|x| + |y|\\) on a circle, consider the points where the line \\(|x| + |y| = k\\) is tangent to the circle or passes through the circle's endpoints.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Boundaries:** Utilize the symmetry of the circle. Since the circle is symmetric about both axes, the maximum value of \\(|x| + |y|\\) will occur at points symmetrically placed about the axes, such as \\((1, 0)\\) or \\((0, 1)\\).\n\n4. **Substitution and Testing:** Substitute specific points on the circle (like \\((1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), \\((0, -1)\\)) into the expression \\(|x| + |y|\\) to test for the maximum value.\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining the maximum value, verify it by ensuring that the points used for calculation indeed satisfy the original equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
