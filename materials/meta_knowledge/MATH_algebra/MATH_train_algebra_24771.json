{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Variation:** Recall that if \\( a \\) varies inversely with \\( b^2 \\), then \\( a \\cdot b^2 = k \\) for some constant \\( k \\). This relationship is crucial for setting up and solving the problem.\n\n2. **Finding the Constant \\( k \\):** Use the given values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to determine the constant \\( k \\). For example, if \\( a = 9 \\) when \\( b = 2 \\), then \\( 9 \\cdot 2^2 = k \\).\n\n3. **Using the Constant \\( k \\):** Once \\( k \\) is found, use it to find the value of \\( a \\) for another given value of \\( b \\). For instance, if \\( b = 3 \\), then \\( a \\cdot 3^2 = k \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that arithmetic calculations are performed accurately, as errors in calculating \\( k \\) or in subsequent steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking if the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) satisfy the original inverse variation relationship.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inverse variation."}
