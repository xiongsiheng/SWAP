{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Recall that if two quantities are inversely proportional, their product is constant. In this case, the product of the number of gallons of coffee and the hours of sleep is a constant.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the information given to set up an equation based on the inverse proportionality. For example, if \\( c \\) is the number of gallons of coffee and \\( s \\) is the number of hours of sleep, then \\( c \times s = k \\) where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n3. **Calculating the Constant:** Use the data from one day to find the value of \\( k \\). In this problem, you can use the information from Monday to calculate \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Solving for the Unknown:** Once you have the value of \\( k \\), use it to find the number of gallons of coffee for the other day by substituting the known value of sleep into the equation.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when multiplying or dividing, as these steps are crucial in problems involving inverse proportionality.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
