{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure correct simplification. Multiplication is associative and commutative, so you can multiply the terms in any order.\n\n2. **Multiplication of Exponents:** When multiplying terms with exponents, add the exponents if the bases are the same. For example, \\((a^m) \\cdot (a^n) = a^{m+n}\\).\n\n3. **Division of Exponents:** When dividing terms with exponents, subtract the exponents if the bases are the same. For example, \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying Fractions:** Simplify fractions by canceling common factors in the numerator and the denominator.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each operation, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with exponents and fractions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
