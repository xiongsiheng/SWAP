{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the value of \\(a\\) for perpendicular lines, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope of a Line:** The slope of a line given by \\(y = mx + b\\) is \\(m\\). For the first equation \\(y = 2x + 13\\), the slope is \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Perpendicular Slopes:** Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\). Therefore, if the slope of the first line is \\(2\\), the slope of the second line must be \\(-\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Converting to Slope-Intercept Form:** Convert the second equation \\(6y + ax = 6\\) to slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\) by solving for \\(y\\). This involves isolating \\(y\\) and identifying the slope \\(m\\).\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:** Once the slope of the second line is identified, set up the equation \\(2 \times m = -1\\) and solve for \\(m\\). This will give you the required slope for the second line.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(a\\):** Use the identified slope \\(m\\) to solve for \\(a\\) in the equation of the second line. This involves substituting the slope \\(m\\) into the equation derived from converting the second line to slope-intercept form.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and ensure that the slopes indeed multiply to \\(-1\\) to confirm that the lines are perpendicular.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving for \\(a\\) in the context of perpendicular lines."}
