{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying polynomial expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms, which are terms with the same variable raised to the same power. For example, \\(x^5\\) can only be combined with other \\(x^5\\) terms.\n\n2. **Distributing Negatives:** When subtracting a polynomial, distribute the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses. This means changing the sign of each term in the polynomial being subtracted.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations, which in this context means handling parentheses first and then combining like terms.\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Ensure that each step of simplification is correct before moving on to the next step. This includes correctly distributing, adding, and subtracting terms.\n\n5. **Final Polynomial Format:** Arrange the final polynomial with the degrees of the terms in decreasing order, as specified in the problem. This helps in clearly presenting the simplified form and checking for any missed terms.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying polynomial expressions."}
