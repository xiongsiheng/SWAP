{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the first term in a geometric sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). For example, if the sequence is a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ..., then the nth term is ar^(n-1).\n\n2. **Identifying the Common Ratio:** To find the common ratio, divide any term by the term immediately preceding it. In this case, you can use the terms 32 and 64 to find the common ratio as 64/32 = 2.\n\n3. **Using the Known Terms:** Once you have the common ratio, use the known terms to set up an equation. For example, if 32 is the fourth term, then ar^3 = 32.\n\n4. **Solving for the First Term:** Substitute the common ratio into the equation and solve for the first term (a). For instance, if r = 2 and ar^3 = 32, then a(2)^3 = 32, which simplifies to a(8) = 32, so a = 32/8 = 4.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by ensuring that the sequence starting from the first term and using the common ratio matches the given sequence.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the first term in a geometric sequence."}
