{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Fraction Addition:** When adding fractions, ensure that you find a common denominator. For instance, when dealing with \\(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a}\\), the common denominator would be \\(abc\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** After finding the common denominator and adding the fractions, simplify the resulting fraction to its simplest form. This involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n3. **Substitution:** When substituting specific values like \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 12\\), and \\(c = 9\\), perform the substitution accurately to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, especially multiplication and division, as these can lead to errors if not done carefully.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the value of \\(J(a, b, c)\\), it can be helpful to double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
