{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have rational roots, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be a perfect square. In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -7\\), so the discriminant is \\(49 + 4c\\).\n\n2. **Perfect Square Check:** Ensure that \\(49 + 4c\\) is a perfect square for the roots to be rational. This involves checking which values of \\(c\\) make \\(49 + 4c\\) a square of an integer.\n\n3. **Integral Range:** Since \\(c \\leq 25\\), you need to check all integer values of \\(c\\) within this range to see which ones satisfy the perfect square condition.\n\n4. **Summation of Values:** After identifying the valid values of \\(c\\), sum them up correctly to get the final answer. Ensure no values are missed or duplicated in the summation.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify each value of \\(c\\) by substituting it back into the discriminant condition to confirm it is a perfect square.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
