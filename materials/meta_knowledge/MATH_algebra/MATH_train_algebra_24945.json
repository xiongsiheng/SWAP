{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Calculating Success Rates:** Understand how to calculate success rates correctly. The success rate is calculated by dividing the number of successful attempts by the total number of attempts and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n2. **Combining Success Rates:** When combining success rates from different sets of attempts, ensure you are adding the correct number of successful attempts to the total number of attempts before recalculating the overall success rate.\n\n3. **Percentage Points vs. Percentage:** Be clear on the difference between percentage points and percentage. A change in percentage points is the difference between two percentages, while a percentage change is a relative change.\n\n4. **Rounding Correctly:** When rounding to the nearest whole number, remember that if the decimal is 0.5 or higher, you round up; if it's less than 0.5, you round down.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and percentages, as these can be prone to arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
