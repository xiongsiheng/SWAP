{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding and Simplifying:** When dealing with equations involving polynomials, ensure that you expand both sides fully and simplify each term correctly. This includes distributing multipliers across parentheses and combining like terms.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Arrange the equation so that one side is zero. This helps in identifying the roots of the polynomial, which is crucial for finding the values of \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) when solving for \\( x \\) in a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). Ensure that you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, verify that each solution satisfies the original equation. This step is particularly important when dealing with equations that might produce non-real or extraneous solutions.\n\n5. **Simplifying Fractions:** When expressing the answer as a fraction, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms. This involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
