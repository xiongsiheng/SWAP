{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Use algebraic identities to simplify expressions. For example, the identity for the sum of cubes is \\(x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Substitute known values into the identities to simplify the expression further. In this case, you know \\(x + y = 9\\) and \\(xy = 10\\).\n\n3. **Quadratic Equations:** Recall that \\(x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy\\). This can be used to find \\(x^2 + y^2\\) given \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic calculations, especially when squaring numbers and multiplying them. Small errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating \\(x^3 + y^3\\), consider verifying your answer by checking if it satisfies the original conditions \\(x + y = 9\\) and \\(xy = 10\\), though direct substitution of specific values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might not be feasible without solving for them explicitly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
