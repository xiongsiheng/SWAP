{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors:** A perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line that intersects the segment at its midpoint and forms a right angle with it. This means the slope of the bisector is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the segment.\n\n2. **Calculating Midpoint:** The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n3. **Slope Calculation:** The slope of a line segment from \\((x_1, y_1)\\) to \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\).\n\n4. **Equation of a Line:** The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept. For a line \\(x + y = b\\), the slope is -1.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** Once you find the midpoint and use the slope relationship to confirm perpendicularity, substitute the coordinates of the midpoint into the line equation to find \\(b\\). Always verify that the calculated value satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
