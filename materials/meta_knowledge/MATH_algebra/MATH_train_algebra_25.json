{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents:** Recognize that powers of the same base can be equated by equating their exponents. For example, if \\(a^m = a^n\\), then \\(m = n\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Bases:** Simplify the bases if possible. In this case, note that \\(4 = 2^2\\) and \\(8 = 2^3\\), so \\(4^6 = (2^2)^6 = 2^{12}\\) and \\(8^n = (2^3)^n = 2^{3n}\\).\n\n3. **Equating Exponents:** Once the bases are simplified and expressed with the same base, equate the exponents: \\(2^{12} = 2^{3n}\\), thus \\(12 = 3n\\).\n\n4. **Solving for the Variable:** Solve the resulting linear equation for \\(n\\) by isolating \\(n\\). In this case, \\(n = \frac{12}{3} = 4\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting \\(n\\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
