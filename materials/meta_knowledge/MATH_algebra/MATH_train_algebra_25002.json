{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up the Equation:** Ensure that the equation accurately represents the problem statement. For instance, if the problem states that the square of three times an integer minus the integer equals 2010, the equation should be set up as \\((3x)^2 - x = 2010\\), where \\(x\\) is the positive integer.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Equation:** When simplifying the equation, be careful with operations involving squares and multiplications. For example, \\((3x)^2\\) simplifies to \\(9x^2\\), not \\(3x^2\\).\n\n3. **Solving for the Variable:** Use appropriate algebraic techniques to solve for the variable. This might involve factoring, using the quadratic formula, or other algebraic manipulations.\n\n4. **Checking for Positive Integers:** Since the problem specifies a positive integer, ensure that any solutions found are indeed positive integers.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the given condition. This step is crucial to verify that the solution is correct and meets the problem's requirements.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
