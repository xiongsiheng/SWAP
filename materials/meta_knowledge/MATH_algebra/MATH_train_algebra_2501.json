{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Values:** Recall the definition of absolute value, which is the distance of a number from zero on the number line. For any number \\( x \\), \\( |x| \\) is always non-negative.\n\n2. **Inequality Chains:** When dealing with chained inequalities like \\( a < b < c \\), solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solution sets.\n\n3. **Case Analysis for Absolute Values:** Break down the problem into cases based on the sign of the expressions inside the absolute values. For example, \\( |n| \\) can be \\( n \\) if \\( n \\geq 0 \\) or \\( -n \\) if \\( n < 0 \\).\n\n4. **Combining Solutions:** After solving each case, combine the solutions to find all possible integer solutions that satisfy the original inequality.\n\n5. **Summing Integer Solutions:** Once you have identified all integer solutions, sum them directly. Ensure that each solution is counted only once and that there are no arithmetic errors in summing.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
