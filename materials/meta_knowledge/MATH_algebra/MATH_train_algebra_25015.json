{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this product, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution:** Accurately substitute the given value of \\( n \\) into the expression. In this case, substitute \\( n = 2 \\) into each term of the product.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations, which is multiplication in this case. Multiply the numbers from left to right.\n\n3. **Avoiding Calculation Mistakes:** Double-check each multiplication step to ensure accuracy. Simple arithmetic errors can significantly alter the final result.\n\n4. **Use of Calculators:** If permitted, use a calculator to minimize computational errors, especially when dealing with multiple multiplications.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the product, consider verifying the result by performing the multiplication again or using a different method to confirm the answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such products."}
