{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Slope-Intercept Form:** Recognize that the lines are represented in the form \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept. This form is crucial for determining the equations of the lines.\n\n2. **Calculating Slope:** The slope \\( m \\) of a line can be calculated using two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) as \\( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\). Ensure you correctly identify the points from the diagram.\n\n3. **Finding the Equation of a Line:** Once you have the slope and a point through which the line passes, use the point-slope form \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\) to find the equation of the line. Convert this to the slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\) at a Given \\( y \\):** To find the \\( x \\)-coordinate where the line intersects \\( y = 15 \\), substitute \\( y = 15 \\) into the line's equation and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Calculating Differences:** After finding the \\( x \\)-coordinates for both lines at \\( y = 15 \\), calculate the positive difference between these coordinates. Ensure you perform the subtraction correctly and take the absolute value if necessary.\n\n6. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify all calculations, especially those involving slopes and intersections, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
