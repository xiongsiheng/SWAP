{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution of Coordinates:** When substituting the coordinates of the point into the equation of the line, ensure that you substitute both the x and y values correctly. This means replacing x with \\(\frac{1}{4}\\) and y with \\(-6\\) in the equation.\n\n2. **Simplification of Equations:** After substitution, simplify the equation step by step. Pay close attention to operations involving fractions and negative signs, as these are common sources of error.\n\n3. **Isolation of Variables:** When solving for a variable like \\(k\\), isolate \\(k\\) on one side of the equation. This often involves performing the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and negative numbers, to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a value for \\(k\\), substitute it back into the equation along with the point coordinates to verify that the equation holds True. This step confirms the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
