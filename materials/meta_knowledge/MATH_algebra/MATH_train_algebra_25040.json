{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Remember the algebraic identity \\((x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\\). This identity is crucial for expressing \\(x^2 + y^2\\) in terms of \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Use the given values of \\((x + y)^2\\) and \\(xy\\) to substitute into the identity. This will help you isolate \\(x^2 + y^2\\).\n\n3. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be careful not to confuse \\(x^2 + y^2\\) with \\((x + y)^2\\). They are not the same; \\(x^2 + y^2\\) does not include the \\(2xy\\) term.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with negative numbers and squares.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by checking if the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy the original equations also satisfy the derived value of \\(x^2 + y^2\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
