{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Fraction Calculation:** When calculating the number of students absent, ensure you correctly apply the fractions to the respective groups (boys and girls). For example, to find the number of absent boys, multiply the total number of boys by \\(\frac{1}{10}\\), and for girls, multiply the total number of girls by \\(\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Summing Absentees:** After calculating the number of absent boys and girls, add these numbers together to find the total number of absent students.\n\n3. **Percentage Calculation:** To find the percentage of the total student population that is absent, divide the total number of absent students by the total number of students, and then multiply by 100. Ensure you use the correct total number of students in this calculation.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and percentages, as small errors can significantly affect the final result.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations to ensure that each step is performed correctly, and the final answer is reasonable given the context of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
