{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Compound Interest Formula:** Use the formula for compound interest, \\( A = P \\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \\), where \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\( t \\) years, \\( P \\) is the principal amount, \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate, \\( n \\) is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and \\( t \\) is the number of years.\n\n2. **Simple Interest Formula:** Use the formula for simple interest, \\( A = P(1 + rt) \\), where \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\( t \\) years, \\( P \\) is the principal amount, \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate, and \\( t \\) is the number of years.\n\n3. **Partial Payments and Interest Accrual:** When a partial payment is made, calculate the remaining balance and continue to accrue interest on the remaining amount.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are done accurately, especially when dealing with percentages and interest rates. Use a calculator to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Rounding:** When rounding to the nearest dollar, ensure that you follow standard rounding rules (round up if the decimal is 0.5 or more, round down if it is less than 0.5).\n\n6. **Comparison of Final Amounts:** After calculating the total amounts under both schemes, find the positive difference between them to determine the amount Alex saves or owes more.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
