{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the length of segment \\(AB\\): \\( \text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\).\n\n2. **Vector Addition:** Understand how to add vectors. If \\(B\\) is the endpoint and \\(C\\) is found by extending \\(B\\) by a fraction of \\(AB\\), calculate the vector \\(BC\\) as \\( \frac{1}{3} \times \text{vector } AB \\).\n\n3. **Coordinate Calculation:** To find the coordinates of \\(C\\), add the vector \\(BC\\) to the coordinates of \\(B\\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, to avoid rounding errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the coordinates of \\(C\\) by ensuring that the distance \\(BC\\) matches the given proportion of \\(AB\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
