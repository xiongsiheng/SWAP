{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents:** Remember the rules for exponents, such as \\(a^{-n} = \\frac{1}{a^n}\\) and \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\). This will help in handling terms like \\(x^{-3}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** When multiplying fractions, simplify the numerators and denominators separately before multiplying them together. This can often simplify the process and reduce the chance of errors.\n\n3. **Canceling Terms:** Look for common factors in the numerators and denominators that can be canceled out. This step is crucial in simplifying the expression efficiently.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) carefully, especially when dealing with multiple operations within the same expression.\n\n5. **Double-Check Simplifications:** After simplifying, double-check your work to ensure that all steps were performed correctly and that the final expression is indeed simplified.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying such expressions."}
