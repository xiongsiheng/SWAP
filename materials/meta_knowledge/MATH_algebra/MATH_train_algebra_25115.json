{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponent Rules:** Familiarize yourself with exponent rules, such as \\(a^{-n} = \\frac{1}{a^n}\\) and \\(a^{\\frac{1}{n}} = \\sqrt[n]{a}\\). This will help in correctly interpreting and simplifying expressions like \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Exponents:** When simplifying expressions with exponents, ensure that you apply the rules correctly. For example, \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1}\\) simplifies to 8.\n\n3. **Solving Cubic Equations:** For equations like \\((m-4)^3 = k\\), take the cube root of both sides to isolate \\(m-4\\). Remember that the cube root of a number has only one real solution.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and negative exponents, as these can lead to common mistakes.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
