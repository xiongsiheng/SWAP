{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of sum, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Series:** Recognize that this is a simple arithmetic series where each term increases by \\(\frac{1}{5}\\). The series can be written as \\(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{5} + \\ldots + \frac{10}{5}\\).\n\n2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Series:** The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula \\(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a + l)\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term, \\(l\\) is the last term, and \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Applying the Formula:** In this case, \\(a = \frac{1}{5}\\), \\(l = \frac{10}{5}\\), and \\(n = 10\\). Plug these values into the formula to find the sum.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Ensure that you simplify the result correctly, especially when dealing with fractions. Combine the numerators over the common denominator.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify the arithmetic operations, particularly the addition and multiplication involved in the formula, to avoid computational errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while computing such sums."}
