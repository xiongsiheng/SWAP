{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of the roots of a polynomial equation, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Polynomial Roots:** Recall that for a polynomial equation of the form \\(ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \\cdots + k = 0\\), the sum of the roots (taken with their multiplicities) for a cubic equation \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\) is given by \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient Analysis:** Identify the coefficients correctly. In the given equation \\(4x^3 + 5x^2 - 8x = 0\\), \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Sum:** Use the formula \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\) to find the sum of the roots directly. This avoids the need to solve the equation for individual roots, which can be complex and error-prone.\n\n4. **Decimal Precision:** When expressing the sum as a decimal, ensure you round to the nearest hundredth accurately to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n5. **Verification:** Although not always applicable, if possible, verify your result by checking against known properties of polynomial roots or by solving the equation numerically and summing the roots found.\n\nThese guidelines should help minimize errors in calculating the sum of the roots of polynomial equations."}
