{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given equation is a quadratic equation representing the height of the ball over time. The general form of a quadratic equation is \\(y = at^2 + bt + c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants.\n\n2. **Setting the Equation to Zero:** To find when the ball hits the ground, set \\(y\\) to zero, as the ground level is considered zero height. This transforms the problem into solving \\(0 = -4.9t^2 + 3.5t + 5\\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use the quadratic formula \\(t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to solve for \\(t\\), where \\(a = -4.9\\), \\(b = 3.5\\), and \\(c = 5\\). Remember to use the correct units and signs for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n4. **Discriminant Check:** Before solving, check the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) to ensure there are real solutions. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions, indicating the ball does not hit the ground within the given context.\n\n5. **Interpreting Solutions:** After solving, interpret the solutions in the context of the problem. Typically, only the positive solution is relevant, as time \\(t\\) cannot be negative in this scenario.\n\n6. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to the accuracy of your calculations, especially when dealing with decimals and fractions. Use exact values where possible to avoid rounding errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
