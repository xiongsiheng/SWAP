{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Properties of Exponents:** Understand and apply the properties of exponents correctly. For example, \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Bases:** When dealing with powers, simplify the bases first if possible. For instance, recognize that \\(8 = 2^3\\) and \\(64 = 2^6\\), which can simplify the equation significantly.\n\n3. **Consistency in Operations:** Ensure that all operations involving exponents are consistent and correctly applied. This includes correctly adding exponents when multiplying like bases and multiplying exponents when raising a power to another power.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with exponents, as small errors can significantly impact the result.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** After finding a solution for \\(n\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to ensure the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving exponents and powers."}
