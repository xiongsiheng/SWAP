{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations accurately. For example, if Ted's age is described as a relationship to Sally's age, express this relationship clearly in your equation.\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When you have two equations (one describing the relationship between ages and the other the sum of their ages), solve them simultaneously to find the individual ages. Ensure you isolate the correct variable (in this case, Ted's age).\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic when solving for variables. Simple calculation errors can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding a solution, substitute the values back into the original equations to verify that they hold True. This step confirms the correctness of your solution.\n\n5. **Understanding Context:** Keep the context of the problem in mind. For instance, ages should be positive integers, so any solution that doesn't meet this criterion should be reconsidered.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
