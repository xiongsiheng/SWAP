{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding Binomials:** When expanding the product of two binomials, use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to ensure you correctly multiply each term. For example, \\((ax + b)(bx + a)\\) expands to \\(abx^2 + a^2x + b^2x + ab\\).\n\n2. **Matching Coefficients:** After expanding, match the coefficients of \\(x^2\\), \\(x\\), and the constant term to the given polynomial. This helps in identifying the correct values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are distinct integers, consider all possible integer pairs that satisfy the equation. This includes both positive and negative integers.\n\n4. **Minimizing the Coefficient:** To find the minimum possible value of \\(\\Box\\), systematically test different integer pairs for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), focusing on those that yield the smallest possible coefficient for \\(x\\).\n\n5. **Checking Distinctness:** Ensure that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are distinct integers to meet the problem's condition. This helps in avoiding common oversights where identical values might be mistakenly considered.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
