{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Recall that if two variables are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. Mathematically, this is expressed as \\(\\alpha \\cdot \\beta = k\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Using Given Values:** Use the given values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) to find the constant \\(k\\). In this case, \\(k = -3 \\cdot -6 = 18\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Constant:** Once you have determined \\(k\\), use it to find the new value of \\(\\alpha\\) when \\(\\beta\\) changes. Set up the equation \\(\\alpha \\cdot 8 = 18\\) and solve for \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying Fractions:** Ensure that your final answer is expressed as a simplified fraction. For example, if \\(\\alpha = \\frac{18}{8}\\), simplify it to \\(\\alpha = \\frac{9}{4}\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations step-by-step to avoid arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
