{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Separate Calculations:** Break down the problem into smaller parts. Calculate the cost for the days and the cost for the miles separately before combining them.\n\n2. **Unit Consistency:** Ensure that all calculations are done using consistent units. For example, if the cost is given in dollars, make sure all parts of the calculation are also in dollars.\n\n3. **Multiplication Accuracy:** Pay close attention to multiplication, especially when dealing with rates (like cost per day or cost per mile) and quantities (like number of days or miles driven).\n\n4. **Addition Check:** After calculating the individual costs (for days and miles), add them together carefully to find the total cost. Double-check the addition to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Final Review:** Always review your final answer to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem. For instance, a total cost that is significantly higher or lower than expected might indicate an error.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
