{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** Ensure you correctly interpret the given ratios. A ratio of 8:5 means for every 8 blue marbles, there are 5 yellow marbles, and similarly for the new ratio.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the information provided to set up equations that relate the number of blue and yellow marbles before and after the changes. For instance, if \\( B \\) is the number of blue marbles and \\( Y \\) is the number of yellow marbles, the initial ratio can be expressed as \\( \frac{B}{Y} = \frac{8}{5} \\).\n\n3. **Adjusting for Changes:** Accurately account for the changes in the number of marbles. If 12 blue marbles are removed and 21 yellow marbles are added, update your equations accordingly.\n\n4. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Be meticulous when solving the resulting simultaneous equations. This involves careful substitution and elimination to find the values of \\( B \\) and \\( Y \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the number of blue marbles, verify your solution by substituting it back into the conditions of the problem to ensure consistency with both the initial and final ratios.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
