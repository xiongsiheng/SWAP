{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall that for a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the solutions can be found using the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). The sum of the solutions is given by \\(-b/a\\) and the product by \\(c/a\\).\n\n2. **Vieta's Formulas:** These formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), if the roots are \\(r\\) and \\(s\\), then \\(r + s = -b/a\\) and \\(rs = c/a\\).\n\n3. **Distinct Negative Integer Solutions:** If the quadratic equation has two distinct negative integer solutions, these solutions must be integers that are both negative and different from each other. This limits the possible values for the roots.\n\n4. **Possible Coefficients:** Given that the solutions are distinct negative integers, use Vieta's formulas to determine possible values for the coefficient of \\(x\\) (the \\(b\\) in \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\)). This involves considering pairs of negative integers whose product matches the constant term (here, 36).\n\n5. **Sum of Possible Values:** Calculate the sum of all possible values for the coefficient of \\(x\\) by considering each valid pair of negative integer solutions and their corresponding \\(b\\) values.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
