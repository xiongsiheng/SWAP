{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Arithmetic Sequence Properties:** In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. If \\(A, B, C\\) form an arithmetic sequence, then \\(B - A = C - B\\).\n\n2. **Geometric Sequence Properties:** In a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. If \\(B, C, D\\) form a geometric sequence, then \\(\frac{C}{B} = \frac{D}{C}\\).\n\n3. **Using Given Ratio:** Since \\(\frac{C}{B} = \frac{5}{3}\\), you can express \\(C\\) in terms of \\(B\\) as \\(C = \frac{5}{3}B\\).\n\n4. **Finding Relationships:** Use the properties of arithmetic and geometric sequences to find relationships between \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\). For example, since \\(C = \frac{5}{3}B\\), and \\(B, C, D\\) form a geometric sequence, \\(D = \frac{25}{9}B\\).\n\n5. **Minimizing the Sum:** To find the smallest possible value of \\(A + B + C + D\\), start by choosing the smallest positive integers for \\(B\\) that satisfy the conditions of both sequences.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you have a candidate for the smallest sum, verify that all conditions (arithmetic and geometric sequences) are met to ensure correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
