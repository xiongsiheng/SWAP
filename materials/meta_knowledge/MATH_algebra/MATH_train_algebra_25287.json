{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Speed Formula:** Recall that speed is calculated as distance divided by time. For Jill, this means her speed is \\(\frac{x^2-3x-54}{x+6}\\) miles per hour.\n\n2. **Equating Speeds:** Since Jack and Jill walked at the same speed, set their speeds equal to each other: \\(x^2-11x-22 = \frac{x^2-3x-54}{x+6}\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Rational Expressions:** When dealing with rational expressions, ensure you factor polynomials correctly and simplify the expression by canceling common factors.\n\n4. **Solving Algebraic Equations:** When solving equations, especially those involving polynomials, check for extraneous solutions by verifying that the solutions do not make the original denominators zero.\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, substitute them back into the original expressions for speed to confirm they are valid and do not lead to undefined expressions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
