{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of logarithmic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Properties:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as the fact that \\(\\log_b(a) = c\\) implies \\(a = b^c\\). This property is crucial for converting logarithmic equations into exponential form.\n\n2. **Exponentiation:** When converting from logarithmic form to exponential form, ensure that you correctly raise the base of the logarithm to the power indicated by the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n3. **Solving for the Variable:** After converting to exponential form, solve for the variable (in this case, \\(x\\)) carefully, ensuring that you perform all algebraic manipulations correctly.\n\n4. **Checking Domain:** Logarithms require their arguments to be positive. Therefore, after solving for \\(x\\), verify that \\(2x - 7 > 0\\) to ensure that the solution is valid within the domain of the original logarithmic function.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer back into the original equation to confirm that it satisfies the equation, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving logarithmic equations."}
