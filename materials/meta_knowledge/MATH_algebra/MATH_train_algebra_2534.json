{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recall that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference (d). The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as \\(a + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n2. **Identifying Terms:** Recognize that the second term is \\(a + d\\) and the fourth term is \\(a + 3d\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given information to set up an equation. For example, if the sum of the second and fourth terms is 6, you can write the equation as \\((a + d) + (a + 3d) = 6\\).\n\n4. **Solving for Variables:** Solve the equation to find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(d\\). Be careful with algebraic manipulations to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Finding the Third Term:** Once you have the values of \\(a\\) and \\(d\\), calculate the third term, which is \\(a + 2d\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by substituting the values back into the sequence to ensure they satisfy the original conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving arithmetic sequences."}
