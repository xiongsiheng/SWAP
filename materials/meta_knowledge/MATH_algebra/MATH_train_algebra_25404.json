{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Perpendicular Bisector Properties:** The perpendicular bisector of a segment passes through the midpoint of the segment and is perpendicular to it. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the segment.\n\n2. **Midpoint Formula:** Use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of the midpoint of a segment. For endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), the midpoint is \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n3. **Slope Calculation:** Calculate the slope of the segment using the formula \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of this slope.\n\n4. **Equation of a Line:** Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line.\n\n5. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute the coordinates of the midpoint into the equation of the perpendicular bisector to find the exact coordinates of the intersection point \\(C\\). Then, use these coordinates to calculate \\(2x - 4y\\).\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations, especially those involving slopes and midpoints, are accurate to avoid errors in the final result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
