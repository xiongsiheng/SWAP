{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentages:** Ensure you correctly interpret the percentage values. For example, 25% of a number means 0.25 times that number, and 20% of 30 means 0.20 times 30.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into a mathematical equation. In this case, if the number is \\( x \\), then 0.25\\( x \\) = 0.20 \\( \times \\) 30.\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\):** Use basic algebraic operations to solve for \\( x \\). Isolate \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for any arithmetic errors, especially when dealing with decimals and percentages.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the calculated value of \\( x \\) back into the original problem to verify that it satisfies the conditions given.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
