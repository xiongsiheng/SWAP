{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be proficient in algebraic manipulations, such as factoring and rearranging terms to isolate variables.\n\n2. **Substitution Techniques:** Use substitution wisely to simplify the given equations. For example, if you know $b + d = 5$, you might express $b$ or $d$ in terms of the other variable.\n\n3. **System of Equations:** Recognize when you can form a system of equations to solve for multiple variables. In this case, you might use the given equations to express one variable in terms of another.\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:** Ensure that your final expressions or values are consistent with the original equations. Substitute back to verify that the solutions satisfy both the original equations.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the details of the problem, such as the specific relationships given ($ab + bc + cd + da = 30$ and $b + d = 5$), and how they can be leveraged to find $a + c$.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
