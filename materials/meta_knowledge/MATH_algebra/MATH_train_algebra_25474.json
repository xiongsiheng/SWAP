{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly when expanding expressions. For example, \\((a+b)(c+d)\\) should be expanded as \\(ac + ad + bc + bd\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms carefully. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. For example, \\(2x^2\\) and \\(3x^2\\) are like terms.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) strictly. Perform multiplication before addition or subtraction within the expression.\n\n4. **Attention to Signs:** Pay close attention to the signs of each term, especially when distributing negative signs or when terms are subtracted.\n\n5. **Simplification:** Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each step is correct before moving on to the next. This helps in avoiding cumulative errors.\n\n6. **Counting Nonzero Terms:** After simplifying, count the number of nonzero terms directly by listing them out if necessary, ensuring no term is overlooked or double-counted.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
