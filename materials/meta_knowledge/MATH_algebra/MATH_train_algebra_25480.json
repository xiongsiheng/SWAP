{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding polynomials, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Remember that each term in the first polynomial must be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. This is a direct application of the distributive property.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Maintain the correct order of operations, especially when dealing with multiple terms and exponents. Multiplication should be done before addition or subtraction.\n\n3. **Sign Management:** Pay close attention to the signs of each term during multiplication. A common error occurs when incorrectly handling the sign of the product of two terms.\n\n4. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms. This involves adding or subtracting terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n5. **Organization:** Keep your work organized by aligning like terms vertically or clearly marking each step of the expansion. This helps in tracking each operation and reduces the chance of errors.\n\n6. **Double-Check Work:** After completing the expansion, review your work to ensure all multiplications are correct and all like terms are combined accurately.\n\nThese practices will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in polynomial expansion."}
