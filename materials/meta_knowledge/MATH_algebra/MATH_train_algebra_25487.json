{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving exponents, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) strictly, especially when dealing with exponents and parentheses.\n\n2. **Exponent Rules:** Apply exponent rules correctly, such as \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). This rule is crucial for simplifying the given expression.\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values of variables accurately into the expression. A small mistake in substitution can lead to a completely different result.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially multiplications and subtractions, as these can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Results:** After calculating, double-check your results by performing the operations again or using a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
