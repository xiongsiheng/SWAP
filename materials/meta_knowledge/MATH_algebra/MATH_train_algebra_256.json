{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Weight:** First, determine the total weight lifted with the original weights. Multiply the weight per set by the number of repetitions.\n\n2. **Set Up Proportion:** When switching to a different weight, set up a proportion to find the number of repetitions needed for the new weights to match the total weight lifted with the original weights.\n\n3. **Use Correct Units:** Ensure that all weights are in the same units (pounds in this case) and that the calculations are consistent with these units.\n\n4. **Double-Check Multiplication and Division:** Pay close attention to multiplication and division operations, as these are critical in calculating the correct number of repetitions.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the number of repetitions needed with the new weights, verify by multiplying this number by the new weight to ensure it equals the original total weight lifted.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
