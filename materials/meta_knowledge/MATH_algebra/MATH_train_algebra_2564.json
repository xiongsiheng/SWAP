{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing the difference of squares, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Difference of Squares Formula:** Use the algebraic identity \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\). In this case, identify \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) correctly.\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** Once you have identified \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), substitute them into the formula and simplify the resulting expression carefully.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform addition and multiplication accurately, as these operations directly affect the final result.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with larger numbers, to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by calculating \\(252^2\\) and \\(248^2\\) separately and then finding their difference directly, although this method is more time-consuming.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
