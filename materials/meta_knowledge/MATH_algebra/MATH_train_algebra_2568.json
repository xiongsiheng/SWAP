{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given quadratic equation represents a parabolic path where \\( y \\) is the height at time \\( t \\). The ball hits the ground when \\( y = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Set \\( y = 0 \\) and solve the quadratic equation \\( -6t^2 - 10t + 56 = 0 \\). This involves finding the roots of the equation.\n\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** Apply the quadratic formula \\( t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = -6 \\), \\( b = -10 \\), and \\( c = 56 \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Discarding Negative Time:** Since time cannot be negative in this context, discard any negative solutions obtained from the quadratic formula.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Perform all calculations carefully, especially when dealing with square roots and divisions. Use a calculator to ensure accuracy in decimal values.\n\n6. **Rounding Correctly:** Round your final answer to the nearest hundredth as specified in the problem. Ensure you round correctly according to standard rounding rules.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
