{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property (also known as expanding or multiplying polynomials) correctly. This involves multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms to simplify the expression. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n3. **Coefficient Identification:** Identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) correctly from the expanded polynomial. These are the coefficients of \\(x^3\\), \\(x^2\\), \\(x\\), and the constant term, respectively.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform arithmetic operations accurately. Errors in addition or multiplication can lead to incorrect final results.\n\n5. **Substitution and Calculation:** After identifying the coefficients, substitute them into the expression \\(8a + 4b + 2c + d\\) and calculate carefully to ensure the correct result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
