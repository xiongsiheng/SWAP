{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Algebraic Identities:** Remember the algebraic identity \\(x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)\\). This identity simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\n2. **Fraction Operations:** When multiplying fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions, as these can be prone to errors.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Ensure that the final answer is expressed in its simplest form, as a common fraction.\n\n5. **Consistency:** Verify that the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) satisfy both given equations if you choose to solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) explicitly, though this is not necessary for this problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
