{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Nature of the Equation:** Recognize that the equation \\(x^2 = -4x\\) is a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations can have zero, one, or two real solutions depending on the discriminant.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Discriminant:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) determines the number of real solutions. If \\(\\Delta > 0\\), there are two distinct real solutions; if \\(\\Delta = 0\\), there is one real solution (a repeated root); if \\(\\Delta < 0\\), there are no real solutions.\n\n3. **Factoring Techniques:** When possible, factor the quadratic equation to find the solutions directly. For \\(x^2 = -4x\\), you can rewrite it as \\(x^2 + 4x = 0\\) and factor it as \\(x(x + 4) = 0\\).\n\n4. **Checking Nonnegative Solutions:** Since the problem specifies nonnegative solutions, ensure that any solutions you find are zero or positive.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding potential solutions through factoring or other methods, substitute them back into the original equation to verify their correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
