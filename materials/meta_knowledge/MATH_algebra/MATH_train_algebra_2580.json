{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Difference of Squares:** Recognize that the numerator and the denominator are both differences of squares, which can be factored using the formula \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\). This simplification can greatly reduce the complexity of the problem.\n\n2. **Simplification Strategy:** After applying the difference of squares formula, simplify the resulting fractions by canceling out common factors in the numerator and the denominator.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform arithmetic operations accurately, especially when dealing with large numbers. Use a calculator if necessary to avoid computational errors.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure that calculations are performed in the right sequence.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your final answer by substituting it back into the original expression or by using a different method to solve the problem, if feasible.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
