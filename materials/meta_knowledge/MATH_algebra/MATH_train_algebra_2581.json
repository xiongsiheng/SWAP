{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perfect Squares:** Recognize that a quadratic expression \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) is a perfect square if it can be written as \\((dx + e)^2\\). This implies that \\(a = d^2\\), \\(b = 2de\\), and \\(c = e^2\\).\n\n2. **Identifying Coefficients:** For the given quadratic \\(4x^2 + 14x + a\\), identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Here, \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 14\\).\n\n3. **Using the Form of a Perfect Square:** Since \\(4x^2 + 14x + a\\) is the square of a binomial, it must fit the form \\((2x + e)^2\\). Expanding this gives \\(4x^2 + 4ex + e^2\\).\n\n4. **Matching Coefficients:** Match the coefficients from the expanded form to the given quadratic. This means \\(4e = 14\\), solving which gives \\(e = 3.5\\).\n\n5. **Calculating \\(a\\):** Once \\(e\\) is determined, calculate \\(a\\) using \\(a = e^2\\). Thus, \\(a = (3.5)^2 = 12.25\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Always verify by substituting \\(a\\) back into the original expression to ensure it forms a perfect square.\n\nThese steps help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in determining the value of \\(a\\) for which the quadratic is a perfect square."}
