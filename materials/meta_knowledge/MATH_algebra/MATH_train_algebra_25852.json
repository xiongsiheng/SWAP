{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Rational Expressions:** When dealing with rational expressions, ensure that you simplify both the numerator and the denominator correctly. Factorize the denominator to identify any common factors that can be canceled out.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** After simplifying the rational expression, set it equal to zero to find the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation. This involves solving a polynomial equation.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the roots of the quadratic equation. Ensure that you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Identifying Distinct Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct. Check for any conditions that might lead to duplicate solutions.\n\n5. **Calculating Differences:** After finding \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), calculate \\( p - q \\) accurately. Pay close attention to signs and arithmetic operations to avoid errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, substitute the solutions back into the original equation to verify that they are indeed correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
