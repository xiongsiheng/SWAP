{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Binomial Squares:** Recognize that the square of a binomial \\((x + a)^2\\) expands to \\(x^2 + 2ax + a^2\\). This form helps in identifying the structure of the given polynomial.\n\n2. **Matching Coefficients:** When the polynomial \\(x^2 + 100x + c\\) is equated to the square of a binomial, match the coefficients of \\(x\\) in both expressions. This will help in determining the value of \\(a\\) in \\((x + a)^2\\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Constant Term:** Once \\(a\\) is determined, calculate the constant term \\(a^2\\) to find \\(c\\). This step ensures that the polynomial matches exactly with the square of the binomial.\n\n4. **Verification:** Double-check the calculated value of \\(c\\) by expanding \\((x + a)^2\\) and ensuring it matches \\(x^2 + 100x + c\\). This step helps in verifying the correctness of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
