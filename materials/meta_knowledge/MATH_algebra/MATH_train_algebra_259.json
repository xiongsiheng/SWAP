{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the nonnegative difference between the roots of a quadratic equation, consider the following:\n\n1. **Transforming the Equation:** First, transform the given equation into the standard quadratic form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). In this case, adding 36 to both sides of \\(x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36\\) will give \\(x^2 + 30x + 216 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** Apply the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots. Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 30\\), and \\(c = 216\\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Discriminant:** Compute the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) to ensure the equation has real roots. For this equation, \\(\\Delta = 30^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 216 = 900 - 864 = 36\\), which is positive, confirming real roots.\n\n4. **Finding the Roots:** Substitute \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) into the quadratic formula to find the roots \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:** The nonnegative difference between the roots is \\(|x_1 - x_2|\\). This can be simplified using the relationship \\(|x_1 - x_2| = \\sqrt{\\Delta}\\), since \\(\\Delta = 36\\), the difference is \\(\\sqrt{36} = 6\\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check all calculations, especially the arithmetic involved in the quadratic formula and the discriminant, to avoid errors.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy in finding the nonnegative difference between the roots of the quadratic equation."}
