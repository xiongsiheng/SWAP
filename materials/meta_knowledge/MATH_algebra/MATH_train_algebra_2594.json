{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the first term of a geometric sequence, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Using Given Terms:** Use the given terms to set up equations. For example, if the third term \\(a_3\\) is 12 and the fourth term \\(a_4\\) is 16, you can write \\(12 = a_1 \\cdot r^2\\) and \\(16 = a_1 \\cdot r^3\\).\n\n3. **Finding the Common Ratio:** Divide the equation for the fourth term by the equation for the third term to find the common ratio \\(r\\). This step helps in isolating \\(r\\) and simplifying the equations.\n\n4. **Solving for the First Term:** Once you have the common ratio, substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for the first term \\(a_1\\). Ensure you use the correct power of \\(r\\) based on the term's position in the sequence.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by substituting the found values of \\(a_1\\) and \\(r\\) back into the sequence to ensure the given terms are correctly reproduced. This step helps in catching any arithmetic or algebraic errors.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the first term of the geometric sequence."}
