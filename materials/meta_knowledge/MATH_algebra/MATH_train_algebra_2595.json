{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recall that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is known as the common difference.\n\n2. **Formula for the nth Term:** The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n3. **Identifying Terms:** Determine the positions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the sequence by counting the terms. This helps in applying the formula correctly.\n\n4. **Solving for Unknowns:** Use the formula to express \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of the first term and the common difference, then solve for these variables.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), add them together and verify that their sum matches the given condition (e.g., the sequence ends at 26). This step ensures that the calculations are correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
