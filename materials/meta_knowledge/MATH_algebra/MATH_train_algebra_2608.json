{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating a function at a specific value, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value correctly into the function. Double-check that you have replaced every instance of \\( x \\) with the specified value.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression after substitution. This includes handling parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\n3. **Fraction Handling:** If the function involves fractions, be careful with simplifying fractions, especially when dealing with complex numerators and denominators. Ensure that you simplify the fraction correctly to its lowest terms.\n\n4. **Check for Undefined Values:** Before substituting, check if the value you are substituting makes the denominator zero, as this would make the function undefined. In this case, \\( 3x - 4 \\) should not equal zero for the function to be defined.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the value of the function, you can optionally verify your result by substituting the value back into the function and ensuring the calculation holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating functions at specific values."}
