{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the midpoint between two coordinates, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) is given by the formula \\( M = \\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \\).\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the coordinates of the endpoints into the formula. Mixing up the coordinates can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform the addition and division steps accurately. Simple arithmetic errors can result in the wrong midpoint.\n\n4. **Coordinate Order:** Remember that the order of coordinates in the formula is important. The x-coordinates are averaged first, followed by the y-coordinates.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the midpoint by checking that the distance from each endpoint to the midpoint is equal, using the distance formula.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the midpoint between two coordinates."}
