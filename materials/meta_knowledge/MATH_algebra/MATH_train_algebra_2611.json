{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Percentage Calculations:** Ensure you correctly calculate the new numbers based on the given percentage increases. For example, if a quantity increases by \\( x\\% \\), the new quantity is \\( (1 + \frac{x}{100}) \\) times the original quantity.\n\n2. **Total Participation Calculation:** After determining the new numbers of males and females, calculate the total participation this year by summing these two quantities.\n\n3. **Fraction Calculation:** To find the fraction of the league's participants that is female, divide the number of females by the total number of participants. Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations step-by-step to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with percentages and fractions.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure all calculations are consistent in terms of units (e.g., all numbers should be in participants, not percentages).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
