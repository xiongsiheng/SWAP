{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Finding Intersection Points:** To find where two lines intersect, set their equations equal to each other and solve for the variable. For example, set \\( y = 5x + 3 \\) equal to \\( y = -2x - 25 \\) to find the x-coordinate of their intersection.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Once you find the intersection point of the first two lines, substitute this point into the third line's equation to solve for \\( k \\). Ensure that the coordinates you substitute are correct to avoid errors.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all your algebraic manipulations and calculations, especially when dealing with multiple steps and substitutions. Small errors in calculation can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Consistency:** Ensure that the point of intersection you find for the first two lines is consistent when substituted into the third line's equation. This will confirm that all three lines indeed intersect at the same point.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, you can sketch the lines to visually confirm that they intersect at a single point, which can help verify your algebraic solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
