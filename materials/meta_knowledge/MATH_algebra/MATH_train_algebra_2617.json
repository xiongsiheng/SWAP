{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Constant Term in Polynomial Multiplication:** The constant term of the product of two polynomials is the product of their constant terms. This is because all other terms involve variables raised to powers and will not contribute to the constant term when \\(x = 0\\).\n\n2. **Understanding Polynomial Structure:** Recognize that the constant term of a polynomial is the value of the polynomial when \\(x = 0\\). For example, if \\(f(x) = -4 + x + x^2\\), then \\(f(0) = -4\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the given information to set up an equation involving the constant terms of the polynomials. In this case, since \\(h(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x)\\), the constant term of \\(h(x)\\) is the product of the constant terms of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\).\n\n4. **Solving for the Unknown:** Solve the resulting equation to find the constant term of \\(g(x)\\). This will directly give you \\(g(0)\\), as the constant term of \\(g(x)\\) is \\(g(0)\\).\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you perform the multiplication and arithmetic correctly, as these steps are crucial in obtaining the correct answer.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately determine \\(g(0)\\) in such problems."}
