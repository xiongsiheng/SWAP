{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Mistakes:** Understand the nature of the mistakes made by Juan and Maria. Juan subtracted instead of adding, and Maria multiplied instead of adding.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations:** Use the information given to set up equations that represent the correct operations. For Juan, if the correct sum is \\( x + y \\), his mistake gives \\( x - y = 2 \\). For Maria, her mistake gives \\( x \\cdot y = 120 \\).\n\n3. **Solve Simultaneously:** Solve the equations simultaneously to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). This might involve techniques like substitution or elimination.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are done accurately, especially when dealing with operations like multiplication and subtraction.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:** Once you find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), add them to get the correct answer and verify that it fits the conditions given in the problem.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and reduce errors in solving this type of problem."}
