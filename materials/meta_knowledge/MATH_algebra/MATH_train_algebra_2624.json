{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating the Equation:** Translate the problem into a mathematical equation. For instance, if a number is doubled when added to its reciprocal, you can set up the equation as \\( x + \frac{1}{x} = 2x \\).\n\n2. **Clearing Fractions:** To simplify the equation, multiply through by the least common denominator (if fractions are present) to clear them out. In this case, multiplying by \\( x \\) would be appropriate.\n\n3. **Solving the Equation:** Rearrange the equation to form a standard polynomial equation. For example, \\( x^2 - 2x^2 + 1 = 0 \\) after clearing the fraction.\n\n4. **Factoring or Using the Quadratic Formula:** Depending on the form of the polynomial, use factoring techniques or the quadratic formula to find the roots.\n\n5. **Checking for Real Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions are real numbers, as the problem specifies real numbers.\n\n6. **Calculating the Product:** If asked for the product of the solutions, remember that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the product of the roots is given by \\( \frac{c}{a} \\).\n\n7. **Verification:** Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to verify they satisfy the condition.\n\nThese steps should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
