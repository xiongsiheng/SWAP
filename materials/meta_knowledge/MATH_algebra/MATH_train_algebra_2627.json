{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form of a Circle Equation:** Recognize that the standard form of a circle's equation is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. Your goal is to transform the given equation into this standard form.\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** When the equation is not in standard form, use the technique of completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms to rewrite the equation. This involves rearranging terms and adding constants to both sides to form perfect squares.\n\n3. **Accuracy in Algebraic Manipulations:** Ensure that all algebraic manipulations are done correctly, especially when moving terms across the equal sign, squaring terms, and combining like terms. Errors in these steps can lead to incorrect center and radius calculations.\n\n4. **Verification of the Standard Form:** After transforming the equation into the standard form, double-check that the equation matches \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\). This confirms that you have correctly identified the center \\((h, k)\\) and the radius \\(r\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Final Answer:** Once you have the center and radius, calculate \\(a + b + r\\) by substituting the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(r\\) directly. Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately to avoid final calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
