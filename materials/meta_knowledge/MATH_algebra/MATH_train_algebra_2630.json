{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the horizontal asymptote of a rational function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Degree of the Polynomials:** The horizontal asymptote of a rational function depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). If the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of the numerator}}{\text{leading coefficient of the denominator}} \\).\n\n2. **Leading Coefficients:** When the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are equal, focus on the leading coefficients of both polynomials to determine the horizontal asymptote.\n\n3. **Simplification:** Ensure that the function is in its simplest form before determining the asymptote. Simplifying the function can sometimes reveal the correct horizontal asymptote.\n\n4. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, you can sketch or visualize the graph of the function to confirm the horizontal asymptote, though this is not necessary for a purely algebraic solution.\n\n5. **Avoid Common Errors:** Common errors include misidentifying the degrees of the polynomials or incorrectly calculating the ratio of leading coefficients. Double-checking these steps can help avoid such mistakes.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can more accurately determine the horizontal asymptote of a rational function."}
