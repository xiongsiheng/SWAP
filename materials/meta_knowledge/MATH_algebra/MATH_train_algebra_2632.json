{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Intersection Points:** To find the intersection points of two curves, solve the system of equations formed by the equations of the curves. Ensure you solve for both variables correctly.\n\n2. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). Be meticulous with your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** When dealing with expressions involving square roots, simplify them carefully. For example, \\(\\sqrt{a + b\\sqrt{c}}\\) requires careful handling of the terms inside and outside the square root.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the intersection points and calculating the distance, verify your solution by substituting the points back into the original equations and checking the distance calculation.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the form of the answer required (e.g., \\(\\sqrt{u + v\\sqrt{5}}\\)). Ensure your final answer matches this form exactly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
