{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents:** Recall the properties of exponents, particularly that \\(a^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{a}\\). This property is crucial for simplifying the given expression.\n\n2. **Equating Bases:** When you have an equation involving exponents, try to equate the bases if possible. This often simplifies the equation and makes it easier to solve for the unknown variable.\n\n3. **Logarithms:** If necessary, use logarithms to solve for the unknown exponent. However, in this case, simplifying the expression using properties of exponents should be sufficient.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and roots, as these operations can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** After finding the value of \\(m\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step ensures that your solution is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
