{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Ratios:** Recognize that in the ratio \\(A:B:C = 2:1:4\\), \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are proportional to 2, 1, and 4 respectively. This means you can express \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) as \\(2k\\), \\(k\\), and \\(4k\\) where \\(k\\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Substitute the proportional expressions \\(2k\\), \\(k\\), and \\(4k\\) for \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in the given expression \\((3A + 2B) \\div (4C - A)\\).\n\n3. **Simplification:** Carefully simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) is performed correctly.\n\n4. **Fraction Handling:** When dealing with fractions, ensure that you simplify the numerator and the denominator separately before dividing. Also, check for common factors that can be canceled out to simplify the fraction.\n\n5. **Verification:** After obtaining the final answer, it can be helpful to verify the solution by substituting back the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in the original expression to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
