{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating average speed, consider the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Average Speed:** Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. It is not the average of the individual speeds.\n\n2. **Calculating Time:** Ensure you correctly calculate the time for each segment of the journey by dividing the distance by the speed (time = distance / speed).\n\n3. **Total Distance and Time:** Sum the distances and times separately for all segments of the journey before calculating the average speed.\n\n4. **Avoid Common Pitfalls:** Do not simply average the two speeds given; this does not account for the different durations of travel at each speed.\n\n5. **Units:** Keep track of units throughout the calculation to ensure consistency and accuracy in the final answer.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors in calculating average speed."}
