{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value of \\( x \\) correctly into the expression. In this case, replace every \\( x \\) with \\(-1\\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating the expression. This means performing multiplication before addition or subtraction.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers. For example, \\(-1 \times -1 = 1\\), and \\(-1 \times 5 = -5\\).\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step to avoid errors. Start by squaring \\(-1\\), then multiply \\(-1\\) by 5, and finally add and subtract the results.\n\n5. **Final Check:** Optionally, you can double-check your final result by substituting the value back into the expression to ensure it matches the original problem statement.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
