{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation \\(\\ast\\) given in the problem. In this case, \\(a \\ast b = 3a + 4b - ab\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Accurately substitute the given values into the operation. For example, when finding \\(5 \\ast 2\\), replace \\(a\\) with 5 and \\(b\\) with 2 in the expression.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform each arithmetic operation carefully. Ensure that you correctly multiply, add, and subtract the terms as specified by the operation.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to avoid errors in calculation.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by substituting the values back into the operation to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
