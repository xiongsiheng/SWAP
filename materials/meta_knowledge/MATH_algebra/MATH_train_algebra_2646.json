{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Reciprocals:** The reciprocal of a number \\( x \\) is \\( \frac{1}{x} \\). Ensure you correctly identify and express the reciprocal in your equation.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Translate the problem statement into a mathematical equation accurately. For this problem, you should set up the equation as \\( 1 + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\):** Isolate \\( x \\) by first subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation. Then, solve for \\( x \\) by taking the reciprocal of both sides, ensuring you handle fractions correctly.\n\n4. **Checking Your Solution:** Substitute your solution back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition.\n\n5. **Fraction Operations:** Be precise when dealing with fractions, especially when adding or subtracting them, and ensure you simplify correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
