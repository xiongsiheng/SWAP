{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rates and Times:** Ensure you correctly interpret the relationship between work rate, time, and the amount of work done. The formula for work done is \\( \text{Work} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** When setting up equations based on the given rates and times, make sure to use the correct variables and relationships. For instance, if your rate is \\( p \\) and your time is \\( t \\), the total work you do is \\( p \times t \\). Similarly, for your friend, it would be \\( (2p - 4) \times (t - 2) \\).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When you have equations involving both \\( p \\) and \\( t \\), solve them simultaneously to find the values of \\( p \\) and \\( t \\). Ensure you handle the algebraic manipulations correctly, especially when dealing with expressions like \\( 2p - 4 \\).\n\n4. **Checking Constraints:** Always check that the solutions satisfy all given constraints. In this case, \\( p \\) and \\( t \\) must be positive whole numbers, and \\( p \\) must be greater than 10.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the values of \\( p \\) and \\( t \\), verify that these values correctly satisfy the original conditions of the problem, including the rates and times provided.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
