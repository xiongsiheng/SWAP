{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Process:** Ensure you clearly understand the process described. In this case, Shaffiq is performing integer division by 2 repeatedly, which means he is taking the floor of each division result.\n\n2. **Tracking the Sequence:** Keep track of the sequence of numbers obtained by each division step. This helps in verifying the count of steps required to reach the target number.\n\n3. **Counting Steps Accurately:** Be meticulous in counting the number of steps. Each division by 2 reduces the number, and you need to count how many such reductions are needed to reach 1.\n\n4. **Using Correct Mathematical Functions:** Use the correct mathematical function for the greatest integer less than or equal to a number (often denoted as the floor function).\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the number of steps, verify by performing the operations manually or using a calculator to ensure the sequence ends at 1.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
