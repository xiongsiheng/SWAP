{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Consecutive Integers:** Consecutive integers can be represented as \\( n, n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+17 \\). The sum of these integers is given by the formula \\( \text{Sum} = 18n + 153 \\).\n\n2. **Perfect Squares:** A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as \\( k^2 \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer. Recognize that the difference between consecutive perfect squares increases as the squares get larger.\n\n3. **Finding the Minimum:** To find the smallest possible perfect square, start by testing small values of \\( n \\) and calculate the sum to see if it results in a perfect square.\n\n4. **Checking Results:** After calculating the sum for a particular \\( n \\), verify whether the sum is indeed a perfect square by taking its square root and checking if the result is an integer.\n\n5. **Efficient Calculation:** Use algebraic simplification and mental math to quickly check sums against known perfect squares, focusing on smaller values to find the minimum.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
