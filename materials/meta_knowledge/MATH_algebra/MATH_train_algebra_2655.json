{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying expressions involving exponents, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Product of Powers Rule:** When multiplying two terms with the same base, add the exponents. For example, \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\).\n\n2. **Base Consistency:** Ensure that the bases are the same before applying the product of powers rule. Mixing bases can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Exponent Values:** Double-check the values of the exponents to avoid simple arithmetic errors when adding them.\n\n4. **Simplified Form:** Ensure that the expression is in its simplest form by combining all like terms and reducing exponents appropriately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify the simplification by expanding the original expression and comparing it to the expanded form of the simplified expression.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying expressions with exponents."}
