{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Finding x-intercepts:** To find the x-intercept, set \\( y = 0 \\) and solve for \\( x \\). This will give you the point where the graph crosses the x-axis.\n\n2. **Finding y-intercepts:** To find the y-intercepts, set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\). This will give you the points where the graph crosses the y-axis.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** When solving quadratic equations (like setting \\( x = 0 \\) in the given parabola), use the quadratic formula \\( y = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) if factoring is not straightforward.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions you find are valid by substituting them back into the original equation to confirm they satisfy the conditions.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, as these can lead to calculation errors.\n\n6. **Summing Intercepts:** Once you have found the x-intercept and the two y-intercepts, simply add their values to find \\( a + b + c \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
