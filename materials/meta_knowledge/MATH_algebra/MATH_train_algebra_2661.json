{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Cube Roots:** Recognize that \\(\\sqrt[3]{2}\\) is a constant factor in all given equations. This simplifies the manipulation of the equations.\n\n2. **Manipulating Equations:** When dealing with equations involving products like \\(xy\\), \\(xz\\), and \\(yz\\), consider multiplying all three equations together to eliminate variables and simplify the expression.\n\n3. **Simplification Techniques:** After multiplying the equations, use properties of exponents and roots to simplify the resulting expression. For example, \\((xy)(xz)(yz)\\) can be simplified by combining like terms.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic involved in multiplying and simplifying expressions, as errors in these steps can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you derive a value for \\(xyz\\), ensure it is consistent with the given conditions by substituting it back into the original equations to verify correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
