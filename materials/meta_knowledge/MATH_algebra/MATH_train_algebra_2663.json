{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Conjugate Multiplication:** To rationalize the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(\\sqrt{2} - \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Products of Radicals:** When multiplying radicals, use the property \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\). Ensure that you simplify the resulting radicals as much as possible.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After multiplication, combine like terms in both the numerator and the denominator. This step is crucial for simplifying the expression to its simplest form.\n\n4. **Checking for Common Factors:** Look for common factors in the numerator and the denominator that can be canceled out to further simplify the expression.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once simplified, double-check your work by ensuring that the expression is indeed in its simplest form and that the denominator is rational.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in rationalizing denominators involving square roots."}
