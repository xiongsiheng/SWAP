{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) accurately into the expression. Pay close attention to signs, especially when the values are negative.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating the expression. Perform multiplications and additions in the correct sequence.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with arithmetic operations. Errors often occur in simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, so double-check these calculations.\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step. Ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one and that no steps are skipped or misapplied.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After calculating the value, it can be helpful to review the problem and your solution to ensure that no mistakes were made during the process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
