{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Range:** Clearly define the range of integers you need to sum. In this case, the integers greater than 3 and less than 12 are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\n2. **Summation Technique:** Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series if applicable. For a series starting at \\(a\\) and ending at \\(b\\) with a common difference of 1, the sum \\(S\\) is given by \\(S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + b)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Count the Terms:** Ensure you count the number of terms correctly. Here, there are 8 terms (4 through 11).\n\n4. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of off-by-one errors (e.g., including 3 or 12 in the sum) and ensure all integers within the specified range are included.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your final sum by manually adding the numbers or using a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
