{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation \\(a \\nabla b = 2 + b^a\\). This involves raising \\(b\\) to the power of \\(a\\) and then adding 2.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply the operation in the correct order. First, compute \\(1 \\nabla 2\\) and then use the result to compute \\((1 \\nabla 2) \\nabla 3\\).\n\n3. **Exponentiation:** Be careful with exponentiation, ensuring that you correctly compute \\(b^a\\) before adding 2.\n\n4. **Substitution:** When substituting values into the operation, ensure that you substitute both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) correctly.\n\n5. **Verification:** After computing the final value, you can verify the steps by re-computing them to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
