{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of a function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Restrictions:** The domain of a function includes all real numbers except where the function is undefined. Look for points where the denominator is zero, as division by zero is undefined.\n\n2. **Solve for Zero in Denominator:** Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for the variable. These solutions will be points excluded from the domain.\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** Express the domain in interval notation by listing the intervals of all real numbers except the excluded points. Use parentheses to indicate that the endpoints are not included.\n\n4. **Combine Intervals:** If there are multiple excluded points, ensure that the intervals are correctly combined to cover all real numbers except those points.\n\n5. **Check for Simplification:** Sometimes, algebraic simplification can help identify the points where the function is undefined more clearly.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the domain of the function in interval notation."}
