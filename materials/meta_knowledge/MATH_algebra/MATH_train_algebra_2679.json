{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding expressions like this binomial product, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly, which means distributing each term in the first parenthesis to each term in the second parenthesis. This is often remembered as 'FOIL' (First, Outer, Inner, Last) for binomials.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that you perform addition and multiplication accurately. Missteps in arithmetic can lead to incorrect expanded forms.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After distributing, combine any like terms. This step is crucial to simplify the expression fully.\n\n4. **Check Your Work:** After expanding, it can be helpful to check your work by substituting simple values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into both the original and expanded expressions to verify they yield the same result.\n\n5. **Attention to Signs:** Pay close attention to the signs of the terms, especially when distributing negative numbers, as errors in sign can significantly alter the outcome.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while expanding such expressions."}
