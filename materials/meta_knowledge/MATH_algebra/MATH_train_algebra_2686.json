{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value Equations:** When solving equations involving absolute values, such as $|x-5| = 2$, remember that this equation can be split into two separate equations: $x-5 = 2$ and $x-5 = -2$. Solve each equation to find the possible values of $x$.\n\n2. **Quadratic Equations:** When dealing with quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, recall that the solutions (roots) of the equation can be found using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. However, in this context, you are given the solutions directly from another equation.\n\n3. **Using Given Solutions:** If you know the solutions to a quadratic equation, you can express the quadratic directly in its factored form. For example, if the solutions are $x = a$ and $x = b$, the quadratic can be written as $(x-a)(x-b) = 0$. Expanding this will give you the coefficients $b$ and $c$.\n\n4. **Expanding Factored Form:** When expanding $(x-a)(x-b)$, remember the distributive property: $(x-a)(x-b) = x^2 - (a+b)x + ab$. Here, $-b$ corresponds to $-(a+b)$ and $c$ corresponds to $ab$.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the solutions you derive from the absolute value equation match the solutions you use in the quadratic equation. This step helps verify that you have correctly identified the roots and correctly formed the quadratic.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
