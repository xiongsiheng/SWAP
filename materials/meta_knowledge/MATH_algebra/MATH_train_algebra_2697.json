{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Operations:** Clearly identify and understand the operations represented by $\\star$ and $*$. Each symbol can represent one of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n\n2. **Balancing Equations:** Use the given equation to determine which operations correspond to $\\star$ and $*$. For example, if $\\frac{12\\star 2}{9*3}=2$, test each combination of operations to find a match.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Remember the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions. This is crucial when dealing with mixed operations.\n\n4. **Simplification Techniques:** Simplify the expressions step by step, starting from the innermost parts or from the given equation. This helps in systematically reducing the complexity of the problem.\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining the operations for $\\star$ and $*$, verify by substituting these operations back into the original equation to ensure correctness before applying them to the new expression.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
