{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of a function, especially one involving rational expressions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify Critical Points:** Look for values of \\( t \\) that make the denominator zero, as division by zero is undefined. Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Solve Algebraically:** When solving for \\( t \\) in the denominator, use algebraic techniques such as factoring or completing the square if necessary.\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** Once you identify the values that \\( t \\) cannot take (i.e., the points where the function is undefined), express the domain as intervals excluding these points.\n\n4. **Check for Real-Valued Solutions:** Ensure that all solutions to the denominator being zero are real numbers, as complex or imaginary numbers do not affect the domain in the real number system.\n\n5. **Include All Real Numbers:** If the denominator does not equal zero for any real number \\( t \\), the domain is all real numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the domain of the function in interval notation."}
