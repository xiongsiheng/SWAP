{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the first term of an infinite geometric series, consider the following:\n\n1. **Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series:** The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series with first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) (where \\( |r| < 1 \\)) is given by the formula \\( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \\).\n\n2. **Solving for the First Term:** To find the first term \\( a \\), rearrange the sum formula to solve for \\( a \\): \\( a = S(1 - r) \\).\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with fractions or decimals, as errors can significantly affect the result.\n\n4. **Checking the Common Ratio:** Verify that the common ratio \\( r \\) is indeed less than 1, as the formula for the sum of an infinite series only applies in this case.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the first term, substitute it back into the sum formula to verify that the sum remains consistent with the given value.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and reduce errors in solving for the first term of an infinite geometric series."}
