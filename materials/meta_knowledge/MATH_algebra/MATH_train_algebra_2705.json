{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the area of a triangle bounded by lines and axes, consider the following:\n\n1. **Intersection Points:** Accurately find the intersection points of the lines with each other and with the axes. Use substitution or elimination methods for systems of linear equations.\n\n2. **Vertices Identification:** Identify the vertices of the triangle formed by these intersections. Ensure that you correctly plot or calculate these points.\n\n3. **Base and Height:** Choose a suitable base and height for the triangle. The base can be along an axis, and the height will be the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to this base.\n\n4. **Area Calculation:** Use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). Ensure that the units of measurement are consistent and correctly applied.\n\n5. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, sketch the lines and the triangle on a coordinate plane to visually verify the correctness of your calculations.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in calculating the area of such geometric figures."}
