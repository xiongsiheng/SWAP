{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Variation:** Recall that if \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), then \\( y \\propto \frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\). This can be written as \\( y \\sqrt{x} = k \\) where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Finding the Constant \\( k \\):** Use the given values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to determine the constant \\( k \\). In this case, substitute \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\) into the equation \\( y \\sqrt{x} = k \\) to find \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Using the Constant \\( k \\):** Once \\( k \\) is determined, use this constant to find the value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 1 \\). Substitute \\( y = 1 \\) into the equation \\( y \\sqrt{x} = k \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for finding \\( k \\) and solving for \\( x \\) to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Optionally, substitute the found value of \\( x \\) back into the original relationship to verify that \\( y = 1 \\) when \\( x \\) is as calculated.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving problems involving inverse variation with square roots."}
