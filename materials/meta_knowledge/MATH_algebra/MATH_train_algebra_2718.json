{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Intersection of Lines and Parabolas:** Understand that a vertical line \\(x = k\\) intersects a parabola \\(y = x^2 + 6x + 5\\) at points where \\(y\\) is equal to the value of the parabola at \\(x = k\\).\n\n2. **Distance Between Points:** Use the distance formula to find the distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). In this case, since \\(x_1 = x_2 = k\\), the distance simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{(y_2 - y_1)^2} = |y_2 - y_1|\\).\n\n3. **Linear Equations:** Recognize that the line \\(y = mx + b\\) must satisfy the condition that it passes through a given point \\((1, 6)\\). This provides a relationship between \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) (i.e., \\(6 = m \\cdot 1 + b\\)).\n\n4. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations involving the coordinates of the intersection points and solve for \\(k\\), \\(m\\), and \\(b\\). Ensure that the system is consistent and that the solutions satisfy all given conditions.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the values of \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) back into the line equation and verify that it meets all the conditions specified in the problem, including the distance between the intersection points.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
