{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Ensure you fully understand the definition of the operation $\\spadesuit$. In this case, $a \\,\\spadesuit\\, b$ is defined as the absolute value of the difference between $a$ and $b$, i.e., $|a - b|$.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply the operation $\\spadesuit$ step-by-step, following the correct order. Start with the innermost operation and work outward.\n\n3. **Absolute Value:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. For example, $|a - b|$ is the distance between $a$ and $b$ on the number line, regardless of which is larger.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute the values into the operation and simplify each step carefully. Avoid skipping steps to maintain accuracy.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each operation, double-check your calculations to ensure they are correct. This will help catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately solve the problem."}
