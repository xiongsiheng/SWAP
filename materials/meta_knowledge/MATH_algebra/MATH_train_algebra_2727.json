{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Consecutive Odd Integers:** Consecutive odd integers can be represented as \\(2n + 1\\), \\(2n + 3\\), \\(2n + 5\\), and so on, where \\(n\\) is an integer. This representation helps in identifying the pattern and relationships between the integers.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Mean:** The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. For a set of consecutive odd integers, the mean is the middle number if the count is odd.\n\n3. **Middle Term Identification:** For an odd number of consecutive odd integers, the middle term is the arithmetic mean. If there are \\(2k + 1\\) terms, the middle term is the \\((k + 1)\\)-th term.\n\n4. **Sum of Extremes:** The sum of the smallest and largest integers in a set of consecutive odd integers is twice the middle term (or twice the arithmetic mean).\n\n5. **Substitution and Simplification:** When expressing the sum of the smallest and largest integers in terms of the mean \\(y\\), ensure that you correctly substitute and simplify the expressions to avoid algebraic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
