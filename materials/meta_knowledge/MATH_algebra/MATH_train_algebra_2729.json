{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding and Simplifying:** When you expand the left-hand side of the equation, ensure that you distribute correctly. For example, \\((2b + 5)(b - 1)\\) should be expanded to \\(2b^2 - 2b + 5b - 5\\).\n\n2. **Equating to Zero:** After simplifying both sides of the equation, move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. This helps in identifying the roots of the equation.\n\n3. **Factoring:** When factoring quadratic equations, look for common factors and use the appropriate method (e.g., grouping) to factorize correctly.\n\n4. **Solving for Roots:** Use the factored form to solve for the roots of the equation. Remember that if \\((x - a)(x - b) = 0\\), then \\(x = a\\) or \\(x = b\\).\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to verify they are correct. This step is crucial to ensure that no arithmetic or algebraic errors were made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
