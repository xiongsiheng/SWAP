{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the coefficient of a specific term in a polynomial expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly by multiplying each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside.\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms carefully. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure that operations are performed in the correct sequence.\n\n4. **Attention to Signs:** Pay close attention to the signs of each term, especially when distributing negative signs through parentheses.\n\n5. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each step is correct before moving on to the next. This helps in catching errors early.\n\n6. **Final Check:** After simplifying the entire expression, double-check to ensure that the coefficient of the desired term is correctly identified.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
