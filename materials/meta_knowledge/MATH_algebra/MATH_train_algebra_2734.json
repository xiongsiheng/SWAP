{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Techniques:** Consider using substitution methods to simplify the equation. For instance, if \\( y = x + \frac{1}{x} \\), then \\( y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \\), which can transform the original equation into a simpler form.\n\n2. **Quadratic Equations:** Recognize that the transformed equation might be a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula or by factoring, if possible.\n\n3. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Since \\( x \\) is expressed as \\( a + \\sqrt{b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, ensure that your solution aligns with this form. This constraint can help in narrowing down possible solutions.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, as these can lead to computational errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final value of \\( x \\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition. This step is crucial to ensure the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
