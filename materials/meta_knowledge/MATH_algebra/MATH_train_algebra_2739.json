{"Knowledge": "To accurately determine the cost of gas used for the trip, consider the following:\n\n1. **Calculate the Distance Traveled:** Subtract the initial odometer reading from the final reading to find the total miles driven.\n\n2. **Determine Gallons Used:** Divide the total miles driven by the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating to find the number of gallons consumed.\n\n3. **Compute the Cost:** Multiply the number of gallons used by the price per gallon to find the total cost.\n\n4. **Rounding:** Round the final cost to the nearest cent to present the answer accurately.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Ensure all calculations are precise, especially when dealing with division and multiplication, as these steps directly affect the final cost.\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to detail, you can minimize errors and accurately calculate the cost of gas used for the trip."}
