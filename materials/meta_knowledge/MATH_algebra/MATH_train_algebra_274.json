{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the equation.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Discriminant:** Calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) accurately. This value determines the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be meticulous with arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions. Small errors can significantly affect the solutions.\n\n4. **Identifying Solutions:** Once you have the roots, ensure you correctly identify which is the larger root to find the positive difference between them.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations and finding the positive difference between their solutions."}
