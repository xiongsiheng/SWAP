{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation involving absolute values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value equation $|x| = a$ has two solutions: $x = a$ and $x = -a$, provided $a \\geq 0$. In this case, $|2n - 7| = 3$ implies two separate linear equations: $2n - 7 = 3$ and $2n - 7 = -3$.\n\n2. **Solving Linear Equations:** Solve each resulting linear equation separately. For $2n - 7 = 3$, add 7 to both sides and then divide by 2. For $2n - 7 = -3$, similarly add 7 to both sides and then divide by 2.\n\n3. **Checking Solutions:** Although not always necessary for simple linear equations, it's good practice to verify that each solution satisfies the original absolute value equation.\n\n4. **Summing Solutions:** Once you have the individual solutions for $n$, sum them to find the final answer. Ensure that you correctly add the values, as this is the final step in your solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving absolute value equations."}
