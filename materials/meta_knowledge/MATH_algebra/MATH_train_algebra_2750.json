{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving function values and inverses, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** When evaluating a function, use the given table to find the value of the function at specific points. For example, if you need to find \\( f(3) \\), look up the value in the table.\n\n2. **Inverse Function:** The inverse function \\( f^{-1} \\) reverses the effect of \\( f \\). If \\( f(a) = b \\), then \\( f^{-1}(b) = a \\). Use the table to find these inverse values by reversing the lookup process.\n\n3. **Composition of Functions:** When dealing with compositions like \\( f(f(3)) \\), first find \\( f(3) \\) and then use that result to find the next function value. Similarly, for \\( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) \\), first find \\( f^{-1}(5) \\) and then use that result to find the next inverse value.\n\n4. **Consistency Check:** Ensure that the values you find are consistent with the given table. If a value is not listed and cannot be inferred, it might indicate that there is not enough information to solve the problem.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the final answer, verify each step to ensure that the function and inverse values are correctly applied. This step helps catch any misapplications or misinterpretations of the function table.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving function evaluations and inverses."}
