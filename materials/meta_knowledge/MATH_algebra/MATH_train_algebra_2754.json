{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Completing the Square:** The process of completing the square involves transforming a quadratic equation from the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) into the form \\((x + d)^2 = e\\). To do this, you take the coefficient of \\(x\\), halve it, square it, and then add and subtract this value inside the equation.\n\n2. **Identifying \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):** In the completed square form \\((x + b)^2 = c\\), \\(b\\) is half of the coefficient of \\(x\\) from the original quadratic, and \\(c\\) is the constant term from the original quadratic plus the square of half the coefficient of \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when halving coefficients and squaring them, as these steps are critical in correctly completing the square.\n\n4. **Verification:** After rewriting the equation in the completed square form, verify that expanding \\((x + b)^2\\) correctly returns the original quadratic equation. This step helps confirm the accuracy of the transformation.\n\n5. **Sum Calculation:** Once \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are determined, calculate \\(b + c\\) carefully to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
