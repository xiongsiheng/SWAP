{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving inversely proportional variables, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Proportionality:** Recall that if two variables \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. This can be expressed as \\( p \times q = k \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Using Given Values:** Use the given values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) to find the constant \\( k \\). For example, if \\( p = 25 \\) when \\( q = 6 \\), then \\( k = 25 \times 6 \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Constant:** Once \\( k \\) is determined, use it to find the new value of \\( p \\) or \\( q \\) by rearranging the equation \\( p \times q = k \\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you correctly calculate the constant \\( k \\) and apply it accurately to find the new value. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking if the product of the new \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) equals the constant \\( k \\). This step can help confirm the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inversely proportional variables."}
