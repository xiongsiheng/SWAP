{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the equation of a line and calculating the sum of its slope and y-intercept, consider the following:\n\n1. **Slope Calculation:** Use the formula for the slope \\( m \\) of a line passing through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\): \\( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\). Ensure you correctly pair the coordinates and perform the subtraction in the correct order.\n\n2. **Y-intercept Calculation:** Once you have the slope \\( m \\), use one of the points to find the y-intercept \\( b \\) by substituting into the equation \\( y = mx + b \\) and solving for \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Coordinate Pairing:** Be careful not to mix up the coordinates of the points; always pair \\( x \\) with \\( y \\) for each point.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations involved in calculating the slope and y-intercept, as errors here can significantly affect your final answer.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding \\( m \\) and \\( b \\), substitute them back into the equation \\( y = mx + b \\) and check that it correctly passes through both given points. This step helps verify the correctness of your calculations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure accurate results when solving for the equation of a line and the sum of its slope and y-intercept."}
