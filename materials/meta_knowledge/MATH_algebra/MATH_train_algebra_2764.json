{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractions:** Ensure you correctly interpret the fractions given in the problem. For example, if the tank is \\(\frac{1}{5}\\) full, it means it contains \\(\frac{1}{5}\\) of its total capacity.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations. In this case, you can set up an equation based on the information about the tank's fullness before and after adding water.\n\n3. **Volume Calculations:** Understand that the volume of the tank remains constant, and the changes in fullness are due to the addition of water.\n\n4. **Solving for Variables:** When solving for the total capacity of the tank, isolate the variable representing the total capacity using algebraic manipulation.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic steps to ensure accuracy, as small errors can significantly affect the final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
