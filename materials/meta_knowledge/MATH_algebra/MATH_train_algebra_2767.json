{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Reciprocals:** Recognize that if \\(\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1\\), then \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are reciprocals of each other in some sense, which can be used to set up equations or inequalities.\n\n2. **Simultaneous Equations:** When dealing with two equations (one from the sum of reciprocals and another from the product), use substitution or elimination methods carefully to solve for the variables. Ensure that each step maintains the equality.\n\n3. **Checking Domain and Range:** Since \\(1 < p < q\\), ensure that your solution for \\(q\\) respects this condition. This involves checking the range of possible values for \\(q\\) based on the given inequalities.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and decimals, as these can lead to computational errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer for \\(q\\) back into both original equations to verify that it satisfies both conditions. This step is crucial to ensure the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
