{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Tangency:** Since both circles are tangent to the x-axis, the radius of each circle is equal to its y-coordinate of the center. This simplifies the calculation of the radii.\n\n2. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the distance between the centers of the two circles: \\(\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the centers.\n\n3. **Subtracting Radii:** The distance between the closest points of the two circles is the distance between their centers minus the sum of their radii. Ensure you correctly add the radii of both circles before subtracting from the distance between the centers.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, especially when squaring numbers and taking square roots, as these steps are prone to errors.\n\n5. **Visualization:** Visualizing the problem, perhaps by sketching the circles and their positions relative to each other, can help clarify the geometric relationships and guide your calculations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
