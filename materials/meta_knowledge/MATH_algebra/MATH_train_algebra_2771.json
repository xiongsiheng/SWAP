{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** Recall that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference (common difference). This means the difference between consecutive terms is always the same.\n\n2. **Formulating the Sequence:** Use the given terms to determine the common difference. For example, if the fifth term is 5 and the sixth term is 9, the common difference \\(d\\) can be found by subtracting the fifth term from the sixth term: \\(d = 9 - 5 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Finding Previous Terms:** Once the common difference is known, you can find the previous terms by subtracting the common difference repeatedly. For instance, the fourth term would be \\(5 - 4 = 1\\), the third term would be \\(1 - 4 = -3\\), and so on.\n\n4. **Summing Terms:** To find the sum of the first four terms, add the first four terms together. Ensure you are adding the correct values and not making arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by ensuring that the terms you found indeed form an arithmetic sequence with the given terms. This step helps catch any errors in arithmetic or logic.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
