{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the distance between two points in a rectangular coordinate system, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the two points. For the distance from the origin \\((0, 0)\\) to a point \\((x, y)\\), this simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n\n2. **Correct Signs:** Ensure that you use the correct signs for the coordinates. In this case, the coordinates are \\(7\\) and \\(-24\\), so the calculation involves \\(\\sqrt{7^2 + (-24)^2}\\).\n\n3. **Squaring Coordinates:** Square each coordinate correctly. For example, \\(7^2 = 49\\) and \\((-24)^2 = 576\\).\n\n4. **Adding Squares:** Add the squares of the coordinates accurately. In this case, \\(49 + 576 = 625\\).\n\n5. **Taking the Square Root:** Finally, take the square root of the sum to find the distance. Here, \\(\\sqrt{625} = 25\\).\n\nThese steps ensure that you calculate the distance correctly and minimize the chances of making errors."}
