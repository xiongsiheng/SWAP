{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Transformation:** Understand how transformations affect the graph of a function. In this case, squaring the output of \\( g(x) \\) means every \\( y \\)-coordinate on the graph of \\( y = g(x) \\) will be squared to form the graph of \\( y = h(x) \\).\n\n2. **Coordinate Mapping:** If a point \\((a, b)\\) is on the graph of \\( y = g(x) \\), then the corresponding point on the graph of \\( y = h(x) \\) will be \\((a, b^2)\\), since \\( h(x) = (g(x))^2 \\).\n\n3. **Calculating New Coordinates:** Ensure you correctly calculate the new \\( y \\)-coordinate by squaring the original \\( y \\)-coordinate. For example, if \\( y = 6 \\) for \\( g(x) \\), then \\( y = 6^2 = 36 \\) for \\( h(x) \\).\n\n4. **Sum of Coordinates:** After determining the new point on the graph of \\( y = h(x) \\), add the \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-coordinates together to find the sum.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure the new point and the sum of its coordinates are correct. This step helps catch any arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
