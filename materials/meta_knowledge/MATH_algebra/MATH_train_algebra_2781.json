{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Use of Algebraic Identities:** Recognize and apply algebraic identities to simplify calculations. For example, the difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\), can be very useful.\n\n2. **Calculations with Powers:** Ensure that you correctly calculate powers of numbers. For instance, \\(64^2\\) and \\(36^2\\) should be computed accurately.\n\n3. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as misreading the expression or incorrectly applying the difference of squares formula.\n\n4. **Double-Check Results:** After performing the calculation, double-check your results to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with large numbers or complex expressions.\n\n5. **Simplification Steps:** Always look for opportunities to simplify the expression before performing the final calculation, as this can reduce the likelihood of errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating such expressions."}
