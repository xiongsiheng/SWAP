{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to find the length of a line segment between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\): \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you substitute the correct coordinates into the distance formula. Pay attention to the signs of the coordinates, especially when dealing with negative numbers.\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** When solving for a variable like \\(y\\), isolate the variable correctly. Ensure that you perform the same operations on both sides of the equation to maintain equality.\n\n4. **Checking the Context:** Since \\(y > 0\\), ensure that your solution for \\(y\\) is positive. If you solve the equation and get a negative value, re-evaluate your steps to correct any errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After solving for \\(y\\), double-check your calculations to ensure that the value you found is indeed correct and consistent with the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
