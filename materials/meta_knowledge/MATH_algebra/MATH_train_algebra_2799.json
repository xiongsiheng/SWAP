{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Quadratics:** When factoring quadratic expressions like \\(x^2 + 13x + 30\\), look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (30) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (13). This helps in correctly identifying \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Identifying Common Factors:** In the second expression \\(x^2 + 5x - 50\\), note that \\(b\\) is a common factor in both factorizations. This can help in cross-checking and ensuring consistency.\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are integers, ensure that all factors you identify are indeed integers. This constraint can help in eliminating incorrect factor pairs.\n\n4. **Double-Check Factorizations:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to verify that they indeed give the original quadratic expression. This step helps in catching any errors in the factorization process.\n\n5. **Sum Calculation:** When calculating \\(a + b + c\\), ensure that you are using the correct values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as identified from the factorizations. This step is straightforward but crucial to get the final answer correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
