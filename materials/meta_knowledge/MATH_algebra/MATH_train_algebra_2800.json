{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving cube roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Use of Conjugates:** For cube roots, the conjugate involves the sum and difference of the cube roots raised to the power of three. Specifically, use the identity \\((a^3 - b^3) = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the cube roots.\n\n2. **Simplification Techniques:** When multiplying by the conjugate to rationalize the denominator, ensure that you correctly apply the distributive property and simplify the resulting expression.\n\n3. **Identifying Common Factors:** After rationalizing, look for common factors in the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n4. **Careful Calculation:** Pay close attention to the calculations, especially when dealing with powers of cube roots, as errors in these calculations can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After obtaining the final form of the fraction, verify that the denominator is indeed rational and that the fraction is in its simplest form. This step ensures the correctness of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
