{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the axis of symmetry for a function given a symmetry condition, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Symmetry Conditions:** Recognize that the condition \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\) implies a reflectional symmetry. This means that the function is invariant under the transformation \\( x \rightarrow 2 - x \\).\n\n2. **Identifying the Axis of Symmetry:** For a function \\( f(x) \\) that satisfies \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\), the line of symmetry is the vertical line that lies halfway between \\( x \\) and \\( 2 - x \\). This line can be found by averaging \\( x \\) and \\( 2 - x \\).\n\n3. **Simplifying the Equation:** Calculate the midpoint of \\( x \\) and \\( 2 - x \\) to find the equation of the line of symmetry. The midpoint formula \\( \frac{x + (2 - x)}{2} \\) simplifies to \\( 1 \\), indicating that the line \\( x = 1 \\) is the axis of symmetry.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, verify by substituting values of \\( x \\) and \\( 2 - x \\) into the function to confirm that the function values are equal across the line \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the axis of symmetry for the given function."}
