{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Factoring:** Recognize that factoring a quadratic expression like \\(3x^2 + nx + 72\\) into two linear factors with integer coefficients means finding \\( (ax + b)(cx + d) \\) where \\(a, b, c, d\\) are integers.\n\n2. **Coefficient Relationships:** Understand the relationships between the coefficients in the original quadratic and the factored form. For instance, the product of the leading coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) must equal the leading coefficient of the quadratic (here, 3), and the product of the constant terms \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) must equal the constant term of the quadratic (here, 72).\n\n3. **Systematic Search:** Use a systematic approach to find pairs of integers that multiply to 72 and check which pairs allow the middle term \\(nx\\) to be an integer when expanded.\n\n4. **Maximizing \\(n\\):** To find the largest value of \\(n\\), start with the largest possible products of pairs of integers that multiply to 72 and work downwards, ensuring that the sum of the cross-products \\(ad + bc\\) results in an integer \\(n\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** After identifying a potential largest \\(n\\), verify by expanding the factors to ensure they correctly reproduce the original quadratic expression.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
