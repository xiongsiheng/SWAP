{"Knowledge": "To determine the degree of a polynomial, consider the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Degree:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial with a nonzero coefficient.\n\n2. **Multiplication of Polynomials:** When multiplying polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n\n3. **Identifying Degrees:** Identify the degree of each polynomial factor separately. For example, \\(x^4 + ax^7 + bx + c\\) has a degree of 7 (since \\(x^7\\) is the highest term), \\(x^3 + dx^2 + e\\) has a degree of 3, and \\(x + f\\) has a degree of 1.\n\n4. **Summing Degrees:** Add the degrees of the individual polynomials to get the degree of the product. In this case, the degrees are 7, 3, and 1, so the total degree is \\(7 + 3 + 1 = 11\\).\n\n5. **Nonzero Constants:** Ensure that all coefficients are nonzero, as stated in the problem, to guarantee that the highest degree terms do not cancel out.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the degree of the given polynomial."}
