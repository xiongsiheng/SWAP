{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Polynomial Degrees:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, the degree of \\( f(x) = -7x^4 + 3x^3 + x - 5 \\) is 4.\n\n2. **Degree of Sum of Polynomials:** The degree of the sum of two polynomials is determined by the highest degree term that does not cancel out. If the degrees of the two polynomials are different, the degree of the sum is the higher of the two degrees.\n\n3. **Cancellation of Terms:** Pay attention to which terms in the polynomials might cancel each other out. If the highest degree terms in \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) cancel each other, the degree of the resulting polynomial will be determined by the next highest degree term that remains.\n\n4. **Given Condition:** In this problem, the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is given as 1. This implies that the highest degree terms in \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) must cancel each other out, leaving only terms of degree 1 or lower.\n\n5. **Inferring \\( g(x) \\) Degree:** Since \\( f(x) \\) has a degree of 4, \\( g(x) \\) must have a term of degree 4 that cancels the \\( -7x^4 \\) term in \\( f(x) \\). Therefore, the degree of \\( g(x) \\) must be at least 4 to ensure the cancellation happens.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
