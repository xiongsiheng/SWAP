{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the eighth term in an arithmetic sequence, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Difference:** Calculate the common difference (d) by subtracting the first term from the second term in the sequence.\n\n2. **Use the Formula for the nth Term:** The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n3. **Simplify Properly:** Ensure that all fractions are in their simplest form when calculating the terms.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations for the common difference and the application of the formula to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have calculated the eighth term, double-check that it is in simplest form and that your calculations are correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
