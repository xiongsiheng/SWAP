{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given equation is a quadratic equation representing the height of a projectile over time. The terms \\(-16t^2\\) and \\(60t\\) represent the effects of gravity and initial velocity, respectively.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** To find the time when the projectile reaches a specific height (56 feet in this case), set the equation equal to 56: \\(56 = -16t^2 + 60t\\).\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Use the quadratic formula \\(t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = -16\\), \\(b = 60\\), and \\(c = -56\\), to find the values of \\(t\\). Remember to consider only the positive root since time cannot be negative.\n\n4. **Checking Units:** Ensure that all units are consistent and correctly applied throughout the problem. In this case, time is in seconds and height in feet.\n\n5. **Rounding Correctly:** When expressing the final answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth, use proper rounding techniques to avoid inaccuracies.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, substitute the calculated time back into the original equation to verify that the height does indeed equal 56 feet at that time.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
