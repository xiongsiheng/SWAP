{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that in a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. This ratio is the same between any two consecutive terms.\n\n2. **Formulating the Ratio:** Use the property of geometric sequences where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. For example, if \\(a_1, a_2, a_3\\) are the first, second, and third terms of a geometric sequence, then \\(\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2}\\).\n\n3. **Solving for Unknowns:** Set up the equation using the known terms and the unknown \\(a\\). For instance, if \\(20, a, \frac{5}{4}\\) are the terms, then \\(\frac{a}{20} = \frac{\frac{5}{4}}{a}\\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Calculation Mistakes:** When solving the equation, ensure that you correctly cross-multiply and simplify. Pay attention to detail to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Checking the Solution:** After finding \\(a\\), verify that it fits the conditions of the problem, especially checking that it maintains the geometric sequence property and that \\(a\\) is positive.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
