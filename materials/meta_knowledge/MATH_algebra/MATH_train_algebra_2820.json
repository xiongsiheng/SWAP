{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation:** Start by rearranging the equation to set it to zero, i.e., \\( z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0 \\). This helps in identifying it as a standard quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\( z = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the coefficients from the quadratic equation \\( az^2 + bz + c = 0 \\). This formula is crucial for finding the exact values of \\( z \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Discriminant:** The discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) tells you about the nature of the roots. Ensure you calculate it correctly to avoid errors in determining the roots.\n\n4. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\( az^2 + bz + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is given by \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\). This shortcut can be used to quickly find the sum without needing to solve for each root individually.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, as these are common areas for errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
