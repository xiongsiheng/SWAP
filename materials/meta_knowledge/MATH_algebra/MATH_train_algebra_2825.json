{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Geometric Sequence Formula:** Recall that in a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio \\( r \\). The \\( n \\)-th term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as \\( a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1} \\), where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Using Given Terms:** Use the given terms to set up equations. For example, if the fifth term is \\( 11 \\) and the eleventh term is \\( 5 \\), you can write \\( a_5 = a_1 \\cdot r^4 = 11 \\) and \\( a_{11} = a_1 \\cdot r^{10} = 5 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for the Ratio:** Divide the equation for the eleventh term by the equation for the fifth term to eliminate \\( a_1 \\) and solve for \\( r \\). This will give you \\( r^6 = \frac{5}{11} \\).\n\n4. **Finding Intermediate Terms:** Once you have the ratio \\( r \\), use it to find the eighth term. The eighth term \\( a_8 \\) can be found using \\( a_8 = a_1 \\cdot r^7 \\). You might need to express \\( a_1 \\) in terms of \\( r \\) using one of the earlier equations.\n\n5. **Simplifying Expressions:** Ensure that you simplify all expressions correctly, especially when dealing with exponents and radicals. Use properties of exponents and radicals to simplify the expressions.\n\n6. **Verification:** After finding the eighth term, verify your calculations by ensuring that the terms fit the pattern of the geometric sequence.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
