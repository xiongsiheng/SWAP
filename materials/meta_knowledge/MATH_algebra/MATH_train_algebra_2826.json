{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Consecutive Integers:** Consecutive integers are integers that follow one another in order, without gaps. For example, 3, 4, 5, 6 are consecutive integers.\n\n2. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula \\(S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\n3. **Median of a Set:** For an odd number of consecutive integers, the median is the middle number. This can also be found by averaging the first and last numbers in the sequence.\n\n4. **Using Given Information:** In this problem, the sum of the integers is given as \\(7^5\\). This information can be used to find the first and last terms of the sequence, which in turn helps in finding the median.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for finding the first and last terms, as well as the median, to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
