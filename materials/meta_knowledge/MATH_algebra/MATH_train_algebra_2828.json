{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection of a line with the x-axis, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the x-axis Intersection:** The x-axis is where the y-coordinate is 0. Therefore, to find the intersection, set y = 0 in the equation of the line.\n\n2. **Solving for x:** Substitute y = 0 into the equation and solve for x. This will give you the x-coordinate of the intersection point.\n\n3. **Forming the Ordered Pair:** The intersection point is represented as an ordered pair (x, 0), where x is the value you found by solving the equation.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic when solving for x to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify the point by substituting the x-value back into the equation to ensure y = 0, confirming the point lies on the x-axis.\n\nThese steps will help ensure you correctly identify the intersection point of the line with the x-axis."}
