{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Utility Function:** Ensure you correctly interpret the utility function given. In this case, utility is the product of hours spent on two activities.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** When setting up equations based on the conditions provided, make sure to accurately represent the hours spent on each activity for both days.\n\n3. **Equating Utilities:** Since the utility on both days is the same, set the utility expressions for Monday and Tuesday equal to each other.\n\n4. **Solving for Variables:** When solving the resulting equation for \\( t \\), be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with expressions involving subtraction and addition.\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** After finding a value for \\( t \\), substitute it back into the original conditions to verify that it satisfies both utility equations.\n\n6. **Simplifying Fractions:** If the solution involves a fraction, ensure it is in its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
