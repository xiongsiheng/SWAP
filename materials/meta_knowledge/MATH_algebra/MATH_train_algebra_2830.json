{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients from the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant:** Calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to determine the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and divisions, as these steps can introduce rounding errors.\n\n4. **Choosing the Smallest Root:** After finding both roots, select the smallest one as required by the problem.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, substitute the calculated root back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations."}
