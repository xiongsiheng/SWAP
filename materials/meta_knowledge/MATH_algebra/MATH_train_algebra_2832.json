{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Intervals:** Ensure you correctly interpret the interval notation. For example, the interval \\((1,2)\\) means all numbers strictly between 1 and 2, excluding 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Setting Up Inequalities:** Convert the interval conditions into inequalities. For instance, if \\(2x\\) is in \\((1,2)\\), this translates to \\(1 < 2x < 2\\).\n\n3. **Solving Compound Inequalities:** When solving inequalities like \\(1 < 2x < 2\\), divide each part of the inequality by the coefficient of \\(x\\) (in this case, 2) to isolate \\(x\\). This results in \\(0.5 < x < 1\\).\n\n4. **Intersection of Intervals:** Determine the intersection of the intervals obtained from each condition. For example, if \\(0.5 < x < 1\\) from \\(2x\\) and \\(1/3 < x < 2/3\\) from \\(3x\\), the common interval is where both conditions are satisfied.\n\n5. **Precision in Calculations:** Be precise in your calculations, especially when dividing or multiplying to avoid rounding errors that could affect the interval boundaries.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by testing values within the derived interval to confirm they satisfy the original conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
