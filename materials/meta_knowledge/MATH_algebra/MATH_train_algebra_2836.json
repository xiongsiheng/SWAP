{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation $\\star$. In this case, $(a \\star b) = \frac{a + b}{a - b}$. Ensure you apply this formula correctly for each step.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Perform the operations in the correct sequence. Start by calculating $1 \\star 2$ first, then use the result to calculate $((1 \\star 2) \\star 4)$.\n\n3. **Fraction Handling:** Be precise when dealing with fractions, especially when dividing one fraction by another. Simplify the fractions step by step to avoid errors.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification:** Substitute the values accurately into the formula and simplify the expressions carefully to ensure the correct result.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After obtaining the final answer, double-check each step of the calculation to ensure there are no arithmetic mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
