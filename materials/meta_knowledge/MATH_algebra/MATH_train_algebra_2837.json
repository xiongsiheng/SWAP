{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of probability problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly define the conditions given. In this case, you need to find the probability that the sum of two randomly selected numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is less than their product.\n\n2. **Total Possible Outcomes:** Calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Since two numbers are selected independently from a set of 5 numbers, the total number of combinations is \\(5 \times 5 = 25\\).\n\n3. **Condition Analysis:** Analyze the condition \\(a + b < ab\\) for each pair \\((a, b)\\). This involves checking each pair to see if the sum is less than the product.\n\n4. **Counting Favorable Outcomes:** Systematically count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition. Be meticulous to avoid missing or double-counting pairs.\n\n5. **Probability Calculation:** Use the formula for probability, which is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Ensure that the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy, especially in counting and fraction simplification.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors and ensure a correct solution to the problem."}
