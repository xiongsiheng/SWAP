{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Equations:** Recognize that the given equations are linear in nature and can be solved step-by-step by isolating variables.\n\n2. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve for the unknown variable. In this case, you can substitute the value of \\(\\triangle + q\\) from the first equation into the second equation.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when subtracting or adding numbers, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Once you find a value for \\(\\triangle\\), substitute it back into both original equations to verify that it satisfies both conditions.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure that the solution makes logical sense within the context of the problem, as this can help catch errors in reasoning or calculation.\n\nThese guidelines should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
