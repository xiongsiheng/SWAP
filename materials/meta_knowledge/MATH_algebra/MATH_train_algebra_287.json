{"Knowledge": "To solve this type of problem effectively and reduce errors, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly define what the problem is asking. In this case, you need to find an integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 < 2n \\).\n\n2. **Formulating the Inequality:** Translate the problem into a mathematical inequality. Here, it translates to \\( n^2 < 2n \\). Simplify this inequality to \\( n^2 - 2n < 0 \\), which can be factored as \\( n(n - 2) < 0 \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Inequality:** Determine the range of values for \\( n \\) that satisfy the inequality. For \\( n(n - 2) < 0 \\), the solution lies between the roots of the equation \\( n(n - 2) = 0 \\), which are \\( n = 0 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\). Thus, \\( 0 < n < 2 \\).\n\n4. **Identifying Integers:** Identify the integers within the range \\( 0 < n < 2 \\). The only integer in this range is \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting it back into the original inequality to ensure it holds True. For \\( n = 1 \\), \\( 1^2 < 2 \times 1 \\) is True.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically approach and solve the problem with minimal errors."}
