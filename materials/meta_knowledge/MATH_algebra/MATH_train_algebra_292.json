{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the growth pattern in this problem is exponential, where the number of bacteria doubles each day. This can be modeled by the formula \\( N = N_0 \times 2^d \\), where \\( N \\) is the number of bacteria at day \\( d \\), and \\( N_0 \\) is the initial number of bacteria.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Inequality:** To find the first day when the number of bacteria exceeds 100, set up an inequality \\( 3 \times 2^d > 100 \\). Solving for \\( d \\) will give you the required day.\n\n3. **Logarithmic Calculation:** When solving for \\( d \\) in the inequality \\( 2^d > \frac{100}{3} \\), you might need to use logarithms. Remember that \\( d = \\log_2 \\left( \frac{100}{3} \right) \\) can be calculated using the change of base formula, \\( \\log_2 x = \frac{\\log x}{\\log 2} \\).\n\n4. **Rounding Up:** Since \\( d \\) represents a number of days, and you are looking for the first day the condition is met, round up to the next whole number if \\( d \\) is not an integer.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding \\( d \\), verify by calculating \\( 3 \times 2^d \\) to ensure it indeed exceeds 100. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
