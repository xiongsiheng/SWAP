{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving floor functions and square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted as \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor 3.7 \\rfloor = 3\\).\n\n2. **Estimating Square Roots:** To evaluate \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor\\), first estimate the value of \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) by finding two consecutive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a^2 < n < b^2\\). The floor of \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) will then be \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Using Perfect Squares:** Identify the nearest perfect squares around the number under the square root. For example, if \\(n = 63\\), the nearest perfect squares are \\(49\\) (\\(7^2\\)) and \\(64\\) (\\(8^2\\)).\n\n4. **Precision in Calculations:** Ensure that your calculations are precise when determining the square root. Small errors can lead to incorrect floor values.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by squaring the integer you believe is the floor of the square root and confirming it falls within the correct range.\n\nThese guidelines will help you accurately evaluate expressions involving floor functions and square roots."}
