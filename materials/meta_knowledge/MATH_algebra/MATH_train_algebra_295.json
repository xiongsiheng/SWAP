{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Equation of a Line:** Use the formula for the equation of a line given two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\): \\(y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)\\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Once you have the equation of the line, substitute the coordinates of the point \\((t, 5)\\) into the equation to solve for \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that you perform all arithmetic calculations accurately, especially when dealing with fractions and negative numbers.\n\n4. **Checking the Solution:** After finding \\(t\\), substitute it back into the line equation along with \\(y = 5\\) to verify that the point \\((t, 5)\\) indeed lies on the line.\n\n5. **Understanding the Geometry:** Visualize or sketch the points and the line to ensure that your solution makes geometric sense.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
