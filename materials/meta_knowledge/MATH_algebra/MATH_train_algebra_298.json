{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the equation given is a Diophantine equation, which means it involves finding integer solutions. Techniques like the substitution method or the use of identities can be helpful.\n\n2. **Factorization Techniques:** Look for ways to factorize or rewrite the equation to make it easier to solve. For instance, the equation can sometimes be rearranged into a form that allows for factorization, such as completing the square or using the difference of squares.\n\n3. **Systematic Search:** When dealing with integer solutions, a systematic search method can be effective. Start with small values and incrementally increase them to find valid pairs (a, b).\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Understand the constraints given by the problem (e.g., a and b are positive integers). This can help in narrowing down the search space and avoiding unnecessary calculations.\n\n5. **Minimizing the Difference:** Focus on strategies to minimize the absolute difference |a - b|. This might involve finding pairs of integers that are close to each other or using properties of numbers to balance a and b.\n\n6. **Verification:** Always verify your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
