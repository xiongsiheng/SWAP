{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation given, in this case, $x@y = xy - 2x$. Ensure you apply it correctly for both parts of the expression.\n\n2. **Symmetry and Asymmetry:** Note if the operation is symmetric (i.e., $x@y = y@x$) or asymmetric. In this case, $x@y$ is not equal to $y@x$, so you must calculate each part separately.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be meticulous with arithmetic operations, especially multiplication and subtraction, as these are critical in the operation's definition.\n\n4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions to avoid common mistakes.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** After calculating each part of the expression, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy before proceeding to the final subtraction.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
