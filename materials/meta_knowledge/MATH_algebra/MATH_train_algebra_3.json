{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when performing complex number arithmetic, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Addition and Subtraction of Complex Numbers:** When adding or subtracting complex numbers, combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, if you have \\( (a + bi) + (c + di) \\), the result is \\( (a + c) + (b + d)i \\).\n\n2. **Handling Negative Signs:** Be cautious with negative signs, especially when subtracting complex numbers. Ensure that you subtract both the real and imaginary parts correctly.\n\n3. **Simplification:** After performing the operations, simplify the resulting complex number by combining like terms.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Recheck your arithmetic to ensure that you have correctly combined the real and imaginary parts.\n\n5. **Use of Parentheses:** Use parentheses to group operations clearly, especially when dealing with multiple operations involving complex numbers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
