{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Check for Restrictions:** Before solving, identify any restrictions on the variable due to the nature of the equation (e.g., division by zero). In this case, \\(x \neq 2\\) because the denominator cannot be zero.\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable:** Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator \\(x - 2\\). This step is crucial to avoid errors related to fractions.\n\n3. **Solve Linearly:** After clearing the fraction, solve the resulting linear equation. Ensure that you correctly distribute and combine like terms.\n\n4. **Verify Solutions:** Substitute your solution back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation without violating any restrictions.\n\n5. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** Sometimes, solving equations algebraically can introduce solutions that do not satisfy the original equation. Always check your final answer in the context of the original problem to ensure it is valid.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
