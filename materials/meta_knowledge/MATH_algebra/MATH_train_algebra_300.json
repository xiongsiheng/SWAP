{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identifying Undefined Points:** Before simplifying the equation, determine the values of \\( x \\) that would make the denominator zero, as these values are not valid solutions.\n\n2. **Simplifying Rational Expressions:** Factor the numerator and cancel any common factors between the numerator and the denominator carefully. Remember, canceling factors changes the domain of the expression.\n\n3. **Solving Polynomial Equations:** After simplifying, set the resulting expression equal to the given value (in this case, 5) and solve for \\( x \\). This often involves solving a polynomial equation.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After finding potential solutions, ensure they do not make the original denominator zero, as these would be extraneous solutions.\n\n5. **Summing Solutions:** When asked for the sum of the \\( x \\)-values, add all valid solutions together. This step requires careful addition, especially if the solutions involve negative numbers or fractions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
