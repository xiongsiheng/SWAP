{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Recognize that the given sums are pairwise additions of three unknown numbers. Let's denote the numbers as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The sums provided are \\(a + b = 29\\), \\(a + c = 46\\), and \\(b + c = 53\\).\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the pairwise sums. This will help in systematically solving for the individual numbers.\n\n3. **Adding Equations:** To find the sum of all three numbers, add all three equations together. This step eliminates the individual variables and leaves you with the sum of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the resulting equation after adding the three original equations. This should directly give you the sum of the three numbers without needing to solve for each individually.\n\n5. **Verification:** Although not typically necessary for this type of problem, you can verify by checking if the sums of the pairs match the given values when you assume the sum of all three numbers and divide it appropriately.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
