{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the polynomial \\( f(x) \\) given its properties, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Monic Polynomial:** A monic polynomial means the leading coefficient (the coefficient of the highest degree term) is 1. Therefore, for a degree 2 polynomial, \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\).\n\n2. **Using Given Values:** Utilize the given values \\( f(0) = 4 \\) and \\( f(1) = 10 \\) to set up equations. Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the polynomial gives \\( c = 4 \\). Substituting \\( x = 1 \\) gives \\( 1 + b + 4 = 10 \\), which simplifies to \\( b + 5 = 10 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Coefficients:** Solve the resulting equations to find the values of \\( b \\) and \\( c \\). In this case, solving \\( b + 5 = 10 \\) gives \\( b = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Forming the Polynomial:** Combine the found coefficients to form the polynomial \\( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check by substituting \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\) back into the polynomial to ensure it matches the given values.\n\nThese steps ensure accuracy and help minimize errors in determining the polynomial."}
