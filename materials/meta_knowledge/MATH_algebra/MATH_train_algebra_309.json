{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. The notation \\( f(g(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( g \\) to \\( x \\), then apply \\( f \\) to the result.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply functions from the inside out. Start by evaluating the innermost function first, then move outward.\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute values accurately into functions. Double-check that you are using the correct values and performing the correct operations.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when adding or subtracting numbers, as small errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your final answer by substituting the intermediate values back into the functions to ensure they match the expected results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
