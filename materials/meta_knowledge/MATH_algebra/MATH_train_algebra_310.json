{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Slope:** Recall that the slope of a line segment between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). Ensure you correctly apply this formula.\n\n2. **Coordinate Geometry:** Recognize that if point \\(B\\) is on the line \\(y = 4\\), then its coordinates are \\((x, 4)\\). This simplifies the problem by fixing one coordinate.\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given slope to set up an equation involving the coordinates of point \\(B\\). For example, if the slope is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), then \\(\\frac{4 - 0}{x - 0} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n4. **Solving for Variables:** Solve the equation to find the \\(x\\)-coordinate of point \\(B\\). Be careful with algebraic manipulations to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Summing Coordinates:** Once you have the coordinates of point \\(B\\), add them together to find the required sum. Double-check this addition to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
