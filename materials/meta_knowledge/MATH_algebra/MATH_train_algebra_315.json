{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the y-intercept of a linear equation, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Intercepts:** The y-intercept of a line is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which occurs when x = 0.\n\n2. **Substitution:** To find the y-intercept, substitute x = 0 into the equation and solve for y.\n\n3. **Correct Form:** Ensure the equation is in a form that allows easy substitution, such as the standard form Ax + By = C.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations when solving for y, as errors in calculation can lead to incorrect intercept points.\n\n5. **Ordered Pair Notation:** When reporting the y-intercept, remember to write it as an ordered pair (0, y), where y is the value you calculated.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in finding the y-intercept of a line."}
