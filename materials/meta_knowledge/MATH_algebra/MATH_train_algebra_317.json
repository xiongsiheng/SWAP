{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up the Equation:** Ensure that you correctly set up the equation by equating the two given fractions: \\(\\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \\frac{1+x}{2+x}\\).\n\n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** When cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions, be meticulous about which terms you multiply together. For example, \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\) becomes \\(ad = bc\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Algebraically:** After cross-multiplying, simplify the resulting equation by combining like terms and moving all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\n4. **Solving for \\(x\\):** Use appropriate algebraic methods (factoring, quadratic formula, etc.) to solve for \\(x\\). Ensure that you correctly apply these methods to avoid calculation errors.\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** Substitute the value(s) of \\(x\\) back into the original fractions to verify that they are indeed equal. This step helps to catch any mistakes made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
