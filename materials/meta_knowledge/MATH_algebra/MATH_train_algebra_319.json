{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving fractional exponents, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Fractional Exponents:** Remember that a fractional exponent like \\(a^{m/n}\\) means you first raise \\(a\\) to the power of \\(m\\) and then take the \\(n\\)-th root, or vice versa, depending on which is easier. For example, \\(81^{3/4}\\) can be interpreted as either \\((81^3)^{1/4}\\) or \\((81^{1/4})^3\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Bases:** Simplify the base if possible before applying the exponent. For instance, \\(81\\) can be written as \\(3^4\\), which simplifies the calculation.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when simplifying. Exponents should be applied before multiplication or division.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with powers and roots, as these operations can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Using Calculators Wisely:** If using a calculator, ensure you input the expression correctly to avoid calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating expressions with fractional exponents."}
