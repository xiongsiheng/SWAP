{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Factor:** Always look for a common factor that can be factored out of each term in the expression. In this case, both terms can be divided by 2.\n\n2. **Use the Difference of Squares:** Recognize patterns such as the difference of squares, where \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). Here, \\(2x^2 - 8\\) can be rewritten as \\(2(x^2 - 4)\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\) is a difference of squares.\n\n3. **Check Your Work:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure they correctly reproduce the original expression. This step helps verify the accuracy of your factorization.\n\n4. **Simplify Completely:** Make sure all steps are completed and the expression is simplified to its most basic form. Avoid leaving any terms unfactored or partially factored.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and coefficients, as errors often occur in these areas. Correctly handling these details ensures the factorization is accurate.\n\nThese guidelines will help minimize errors when factoring expressions like \\(2x^2 - 8\\)."}
