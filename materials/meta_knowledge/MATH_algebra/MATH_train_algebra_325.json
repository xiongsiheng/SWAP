{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognizing Perfect Squares:** Identify that the given quadratic expression \\(9x^2 + 24x + a\\) is intended to be the square of a binomial. This means it should fit the form \\((bx + c)^2 = b^2x^2 + 2bcx + c^2\\).\n\n2. **Matching Coefficients:** Compare the coefficients of the given quadratic with the expanded form of a squared binomial. Specifically, match \\(9x^2\\) with \\(b^2x^2\\), \\(24x\\) with \\(2bcx\\), and \\(a\\) with \\(c^2\\).\n\n3. **Solving for Constants:** From the matching, solve for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) to determine \\(a\\). For example, since \\(9x^2 = b^2x^2\\), \\(b = 3\\) or \\(b = -3\\). Similarly, since \\(24x = 2bcx\\), \\(c = 4\\) or \\(c = -4\\). Then, \\(a = c^2\\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Oversights:** Ensure that you consider both positive and negative values for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) if applicable, though in this context, the sign of \\(b\\) does not affect \\(a\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you calculate \\(a\\), verify that \\(9x^2 + 24x + a\\) indeed equals \\((3x + 4)^2\\) or \\((-3x - 4)^2\\) to confirm your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
