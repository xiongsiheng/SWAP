{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Exponent Rules:** Understand and apply the rules of exponents correctly. For example, \\(a^m = a^n\\) implies \\(m = n\\) if \\(a\\) is not equal to 0 or 1.\n\n2. **Base Conversion:** Recognize when you can convert between different bases to simplify the equation. For instance, \\(16\\) can be written as \\(2^4\\).\n\n3. **Equating Exponents:** When two expressions with the same base are equal, their exponents must be equal. This is a key step in solving equations of the form \\(a^m = a^n\\).\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with exponents, as small errors can significantly impact the result.\n\n5. **Substitute and Verify:** After finding the value of \\(x\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step ensures the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
