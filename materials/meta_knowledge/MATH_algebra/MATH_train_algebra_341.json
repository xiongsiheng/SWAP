{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) represents the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). This means \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) is an integer.\n\n2. **Expressing \\(x\\) in Terms of Fractions:** Since \\(x\\) is to be expressed as a common fraction, consider \\(x\\) in the form \\(n + f\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer (\\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\)) and \\(f\\) is a fractional part (\\(0 \\leq f < 1\\)).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Substitute \\(x = n + f\\) into the equation \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x = \\dfrac{13}{3}\\) to get \\(n + (n + f) = \\dfrac{13}{3}\\), simplifying to \\(2n + f = \\dfrac{13}{3}\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(n\\) and \\(f\\):** Since \\(n\\) is an integer and \\(f\\) is a fraction between 0 and 1, solve for \\(n\\) by isolating it and checking for integer solutions. Then, determine \\(f\\) by substituting \\(n\\) back into the equation.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always check your final answer by substituting \\(x\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
