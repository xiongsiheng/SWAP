{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula for an equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant:** The term under the square root, \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), is known as the discriminant. Ensure you calculate this correctly as it determines the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex).\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** When simplifying the quadratic formula, ensure that all operations are performed correctly, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots.\n\n4. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** When the roots are expressed in the form \\(x = \frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\), ensure that \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\) are in their simplest form, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the values of \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\), double-check your calculations to ensure there are no arithmetic errors, and that the values indeed satisfy the original equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the roots of a quadratic equation."}
