{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognizing Patterns:** Identify if the given expression can be rewritten in a recognizable form, such as a perfect square. In this case, notice that \\((2x)^2 + 2 \\cdot 37 \\cdot 2x + 37^2\\) is a perfect square trinomial.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify the expression by rewriting it in a more manageable form. For instance, recognize that \\((2x + 37)^2\\) is equivalent to the given expression.\n\n3. **Understanding Divisibility:** Understand the conditions under which a number is divisible by another number. Here, you need to find \\(x\\) such that \\((2x + 37)^2\\) is a multiple of 47.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic:** Use modular arithmetic to find the least positive integer \\(x\\). Specifically, solve for \\(x\\) in the congruence \\((2x + 37)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{47}\\).\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** After finding a potential solution, verify it by substituting \\(x\\) back into the original expression to confirm it satisfies the condition of being a multiple of 47.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
