{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the equation \\( y = kx^{\frac{1}{4}} \\) represents a power function where \\( y \\) is proportional to the fourth root of \\( x \\). This means \\( k \\) is a constant that relates \\( y \\) to \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\( k \\):** Use the given point \\( (x, y) = (81, 3\\sqrt{2}) \\) to solve for \\( k \\). Substitute these values into the equation to find \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Handling Exponents and Roots:** Be precise when dealing with fractional exponents and roots. For example, \\( x^{\frac{1}{4}} \\) is the fourth root of \\( x \\), and ensure you correctly calculate this value.\n\n4. **Substitution and Calculation:** After finding \\( k \\), substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into the equation to find the new value of \\( y \\). Ensure you perform the calculations accurately, especially when dealing with roots and exponents.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations step-by-step to avoid common arithmetic errors, particularly when dealing with complex numbers or roots.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
