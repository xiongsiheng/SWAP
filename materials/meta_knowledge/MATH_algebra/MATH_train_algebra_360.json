{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perimeter and Area:** Recall the formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter \\( P \\) is given by \\( P = 2(l + w) \\), where \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) are the length and width. The area \\( A \\) is given by \\( A = l \times w \\).\n\n2. **Whole Number Constraints:** Since the dimensions are whole numbers, consider pairs of integers that satisfy the perimeter condition.\n\n3. **Maximizing Area:** To maximize the area, explore pairs of dimensions that are as close to each other as possible, since the area of a rectangle is maximized when the length and width are equal (forming a square), if possible.\n\n4. **Systematic Approach:** Use a systematic approach to test each pair of dimensions that satisfy the perimeter condition and calculate the corresponding area.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations for each pair of dimensions to ensure accuracy in computing the area.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
