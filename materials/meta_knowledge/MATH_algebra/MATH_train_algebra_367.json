{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly to each term in the expression. For example, \\(2(3 - i)\\) should be expanded to \\(6 - 2i\\).\n\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** After distributing, combine like terms. Real parts should be combined with real parts, and imaginary parts with imaginary parts. For instance, \\(6 - 2i + 2i + i^2\\) simplifies to \\(6 + i^2\\), since \\(-2i + 2i = 0\\).\n\n3. **Imaginary Unit \\(i\\):** Remember that \\(i^2 = -1\\). This is crucial when simplifying expressions involving \\(i^2\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative signs and complex numbers.\n\n5. **Final Check:** After simplifying, double-check your steps to ensure that each operation was performed correctly and that the final expression is in its simplest form.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in simplifying complex algebraic expressions."}
