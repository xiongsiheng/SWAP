{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving function composition and evaluation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For example, \\( f(g(x)) \\) means you first apply \\( g \\) to \\( x \\) and then apply \\( f \\) to the result.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating functions. Start by evaluating the innermost function first and then move outward.\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, make sure you substitute correctly. Double-check that you have substituted the value into the right function and in the correct place.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with addition and multiplication, as these can lead to errors if not performed accurately.\n\n5. **Double-Check Results:** After calculating, double-check your results by re-evaluating the expressions to ensure they match your final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving function composition and evaluation."}
