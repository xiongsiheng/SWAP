{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying complex number expressions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:** When subtracting or adding complex numbers, handle the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, in the expression \\((a + bi) - (c + di)\\), subtract \\(a\\) from \\(c\\) for the real part and \\(bi\\) from \\(di\\) for the imaginary part.\n\n2. **Signs and Operations:** Be cautious with signs, especially when distributing negative signs through parentheses. Ensure that each term is correctly affected by the operation.\n\n3. **Simplification Rules:** Apply the rules of arithmetic accurately, ensuring that you are adding or subtracting like terms correctly. For imaginary parts, remember that \\(i\\) is a constant, and operations should be performed consistently with this understanding.\n\n4. **Final Expression Form:** Ensure that the final simplified expression is in the standard form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying complex number expressions."}
