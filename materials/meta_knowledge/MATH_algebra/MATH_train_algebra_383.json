{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Complex Number Addition and Subtraction:** When adding or subtracting complex numbers, combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, if you have \\(a = x + yi\\) and \\(b = u + vi\\), then \\(a - b = (x - u) + (y - v)i\\).\n\n2. **Careful Handling of Signs:** Pay close attention to the signs when subtracting complex numbers, as errors often occur here. Ensure that you subtract both the real and imaginary parts correctly.\n\n3. **Simplification:** After performing the operation, simplify the result by combining like terms if necessary.\n\n4. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by substituting the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) back into the expression \\(a - 2b\\) to ensure it matches your calculated result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while working with complex numbers."}
