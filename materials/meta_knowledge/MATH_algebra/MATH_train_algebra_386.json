{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have rational solutions, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be a perfect square. In this case, \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 11\\), and \\(c = c\\), so the discriminant is \\(11^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot c = 121 - 20c\\).\n\n2. **Perfect Square Requirement:** Ensure that \\(121 - 20c\\) is a perfect square. This means you need to find values of \\(c\\) such that \\(121 - 20c = k^2\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Integer Values of \\(c\\):** Since \\(c\\) must be a positive integer, you need to test integer values of \\(c\\) to find those that make \\(121 - 20c\\) a perfect square.\n\n4. **Product of \\(c\\) Values:** Once you identify the two values of \\(c\\) that satisfy the condition, calculate their product to find the final answer.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the values of \\(c\\) you found indeed make the discriminant a perfect square and that their product is correctly computed.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
