{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure:** A cube has 6 faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges. Each vertex of the cube is formed by the intersection of three faces.\n\n2. **Vertex Labeling:** Each vertex is labeled with the product of the numbers on the three faces that meet at that vertex. This means that each face number is used in three different vertex products.\n\n3. **Sum of Products:** The sum of the products at all vertices is given as 1001. This sum includes each face number three times (since each face participates in three vertex products).\n\n4. **Prime Factorization:** Use prime factorization to understand the structure of the number 1001. For example, 1001 can be factored into 7 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13.\n\n5. **Systematic Approach:** Consider the possible configurations of the numbers on the faces that could lead to the given sum of vertex products. This might involve testing different combinations or using logical deductions based on the constraints.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you have a candidate solution for the sum of the numbers on the faces, verify that it fits the conditions of the problem, ensuring that the sum of the products of the vertices indeed equals 1001.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
