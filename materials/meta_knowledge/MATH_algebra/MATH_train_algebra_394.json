{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes a quadratic function, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Formula:** For a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex, which gives the minimum (or maximum) value, can be found using the formula \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\). This formula directly gives the optimal \\( x \\)-value without needing to graph or test multiple points.\n\n2. **Function Evaluation:** Once you find the \\( x \\)-coordinate using the vertex formula, substitute this value back into the original function to find the minimum value. This step confirms the correctness of your calculation.\n\n3. **Coefficient Accuracy:** Ensure that you accurately identify the coefficients \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from the quadratic function. Misidentifying these can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Negative Coefficients:** Remember that if \\( a \\) is negative, the quadratic function opens downwards, and the vertex represents a maximum, not a minimum. This problem specifically asks for the minimum, so ensure \\( a \\) is positive.\n\n5. **Simplification Check:** After applying the vertex formula, double-check your arithmetic to ensure the \\( x \\)-value is correctly calculated. Simple arithmetic errors can significantly impact the result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the minimum value in quadratic functions."}
