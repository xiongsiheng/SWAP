{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perimeter and Area:** Recall the formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter \\( P \\) is given by \\( P = 2(l + w) \\), where \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width. The area \\( A \\) is given by \\( A = l \times w \\).\n\n2. **Maximizing Area:** For a given perimeter, the area of a rectangle is maximized when the rectangle is a square. This means the length and width should be equal.\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given perimeter to set up an equation for the side lengths. For example, if the perimeter is 24 inches, then \\( 2(l + w) = 24 \\), which simplifies to \\( l + w = 12 \\).\n\n4. **Finding the Dimensions:** To maximize the area, set \\( l = w \\). Solve for \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) using the equation \\( l + w = 12 \\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Area:** Once you have the dimensions, calculate the area using the formula \\( A = l \times w \\).\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when dealing with simple arithmetic operations that can lead to careless mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
