{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving a quadratic equation by completing the square, consider the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form:** Ensure the quadratic equation is in standard form, \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), before starting the process.\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(x^2\\):** Make sure the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 1. If it's not, divide all terms by the coefficient of \\(x^2\\).\n\n3. **Completing the Square:** To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), square it, and add and subtract this value inside the equation.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After completing the square, simplify the equation to the form \\((x + r)^2 = s\\), where \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are constants.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, as these can lead to errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your final form \\((x + r)^2 = s\\) to ensure it correctly represents the original quadratic equation.\n\nThese points will help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations by completing the square."}
