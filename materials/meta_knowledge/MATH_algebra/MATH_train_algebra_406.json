{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Formulating Equations:** Set up equations based on the given conditions. For example, if the integers are \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) with \\( x > y \\), you can write \\( x - y = 6 \\) and \\( xy = 112 \\).\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve the system of equations. Substitute \\( x = y + 6 \\) into \\( xy = 112 \\) to form a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, as specified in the problem.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum:** Once you have the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), add them together to find the sum. Double-check this calculation to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the found values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) back into the original conditions to verify that they satisfy both the difference and the product conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
