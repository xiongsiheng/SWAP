{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) for the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = a\\), and \\(c = 8a\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant:** For the quadratic equation to have integer solutions, the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) must be a perfect square. Here, \\(a^2 - 32a\\) must be a perfect square.\n\n3. **Perfect Square Check:** Identify when an expression is a perfect square. For \\(a^2 - 32a\\) to be a perfect square, it must be of the form \\(k^2\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n4. **Integer Values of \\(a\\):** Check integer values of \\(a\\) within a reasonable range to see if \\(a^2 - 32a\\) becomes a perfect square. This involves testing values and verifying if the result is a square of an integer.\n\n5. **Systematic Testing:** Test values systematically and keep track of which values of \\(a\\) satisfy the condition of the discriminant being a perfect square.\n\n6. **Counting Solutions:** Ensure you count the number of valid \\(a\\) values correctly, avoiding double-counting or omissions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
