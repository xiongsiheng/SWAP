{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** Recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a + l)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\n2. **Identifying Terms:** Ensure you correctly identify the first and last terms of each series. For even integers, the first term is 2 and the common difference is 2. For odd integers, the first term is 1 and the common difference is 2.\n\n3. **Calculating the Last Term:** For the first 20 positive even integers, the last term is \\(2 + (20-1) \\times 2 = 40\\). For the first 15 positive odd integers, the last term is \\(1 + (15-1) \\times 2 = 29\\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Calculation Mistakes:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic involved in calculating sums and differences. Use parentheses to group operations clearly.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Results:** After calculating the sums, double-check the difference by ensuring you subtract the smaller sum from the larger sum to get the positive difference.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
