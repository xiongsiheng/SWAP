{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents:** Recognize that both 64 and 32 can be expressed as powers of 2. Specifically, \\(64 = 2^6\\) and \\(32 = 2^5\\). This simplifies the equation to a common base.\n\n2. **Equating Exponents:** When two expressions with the same base are equal, their exponents must be equal. Set the exponents equal to each other after converting to the same base.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\):** Once you have an equation involving exponents, solve for \\(x\\) by isolating \\(x\\) on one side of the equation.\n\n4. **Using Negative Exponents:** When dealing with \\(2^{-x}\\), remember that \\(a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}\\). This will help you express the final answer as a fraction.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations, especially those involving exponents and fractions, are done accurately to avoid common mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
