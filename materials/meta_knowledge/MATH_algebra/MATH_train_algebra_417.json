{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving inverse functions and tabular data, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inverse Functions:** Remember that the inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) essentially reverses the effect of the function \\(f(x)\\). For any value \\(y = f(x)\\), the inverse function gives \\(x = f^{-1}(y)\\).\n\n2. **Reading Tables for Inverses:** When finding \\(f^{-1}(y)\\) from a table, locate \\(y\\) in the \\(f(x)\\) row, and the corresponding \\(x\\) value directly above it in the \\(x\\) row is \\(f^{-1}(y)\\).\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating expressions involving inverse functions. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first.\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:** Verify that the values you find for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) are consistent with the function's definition in the table. This helps in catching any misread or misinterpreted values.\n\n5. **Substitution and Simplification:** After finding the necessary values of \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), substitute them into the expression and simplify step by step to avoid calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving inverse functions and tabular data."}
