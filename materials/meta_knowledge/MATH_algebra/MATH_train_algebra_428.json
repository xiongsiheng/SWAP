{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Parabola:** Recognize that the vertex form of a parabola is \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. In this case, the vertex is given as \\((2, -4)\\), so the equation can be written as \\( y = a(x-2)^2 - 4 \\).\n\n2. **Finding the Coefficient \\(a\\):** Use another known point on the parabola (e.g., \\((4, 12)\\)) to solve for \\(a\\). Substitute \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = 12\\) into the vertex form equation to find \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Standard Form Conversion:** Convert the vertex form to the standard form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) by expanding and simplifying.\n\n4. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the zeros \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) of the quadratic equation.\n\n5. **Difference of Roots:** Calculate \\(m - n\\) using the properties of the quadratic formula, specifically \\(m - n = \frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}\\).\n\n6. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure that all algebraic manipulations and calculations are done accurately to avoid errors in the final result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
