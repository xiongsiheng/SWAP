{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Remember that \\( x \\cdot (x + y) \\) can be expanded using the distributive property to \\( x^2 + xy \\). This step is crucial for aligning the given equation with the expanded form.\n\n2. **Equating Expressions:** When you have \\( x^2 + xy = x^2 + 8 \\), equate the non-variable terms to find the value of \\( xy \\). This involves comparing the coefficients of similar terms on both sides of the equation.\n\n3. **Simplification:** Simplify the equation by subtracting \\( x^2 \\) from both sides to isolate \\( xy \\). This step helps in directly finding the value of \\( xy \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when subtracting or adding terms. Small arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, once you find the value of \\( xy \\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition. This step can help catch any errors made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
