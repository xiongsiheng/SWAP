{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** For a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\). This formula directly provides the sum without needing to solve for the individual roots.\n\n2. **Coefficient Identification:** Ensure you correctly identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the quadratic equation. In the given equation \\(x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\\), \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = 3\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** When applying Vieta's formula, perform the arithmetic accurately. For example, the sum of the roots here is \\(-\frac{-4}{1} = 4\\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations to avoid simple arithmetic errors, which are common when dealing with fractions or negative numbers.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation."}
