{"Knowledge": "To determine the range of the function \\( r(x) = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\), consider the following points:\n\n1. **Identify Domain Restrictions:** The function \\( r(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\) because the denominator becomes zero. This is crucial for understanding the behavior of the function.\n\n2. **Analyze the Denominator:** The expression \\( (1-x)^2 \\) is always non-negative and equals zero only at \\( x = 1 \\). Since it is a square, it is always positive for all \\( x \neq 1 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Behavior of the Function:** As \\( (1-x)^2 \\) approaches zero (when \\( x \\) approaches 1 from either side), \\( r(x) \\) approaches infinity. Conversely, as \\( (1-x)^2 \\) increases (when \\( x \\) moves away from 1), \\( r(x) \\) approaches zero.\n\n4. **Consider the Range:** Since \\( (1-x)^2 \\) can take any positive value (excluding zero), \\( \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\) can take any positive real number. Therefore, the range of \\( r(x) \\) is all positive real numbers.\n\n5. **Express in Interval Notation:** The range of \\( r(x) \\) is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\nThese points help in accurately determining the range of the function by considering its behavior and domain restrictions."}
