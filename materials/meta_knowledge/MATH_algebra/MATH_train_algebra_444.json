{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that the distances traveled by the ball form a geometric sequence. Each bounce is half the distance of the previous fall.\n\n2. **Summing the Sequence:** To find the total distance traveled, sum the distances of all falls and rebounds. For falls, the distances are 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 feet. For rebounds, the distances are 50, 25, and 12.5 feet.\n\n3. **Geometric Series:** Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series if needed, where the sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series with first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) is given by \\( S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \\), where \\( |r| < 1 \\).\n\n4. **Double-Counting:** Be cautious not to double-count the initial drop, as it does not involve a rebound.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Perform calculations carefully, especially when dealing with fractions and decimals, to ensure the correct total distance is obtained.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
