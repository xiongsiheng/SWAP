{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Range of a Function:** The range of a quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is determined by its vertex and whether it opens upwards or downwards. For \\( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \\), since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards.\n\n2. **Vertex of a Parabola:** The vertex form of a quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\). For \\( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \\), the vertex occurs at \\( x = \frac{5}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Minimum Value:** To find the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\), substitute \\( x = \frac{5}{2} \\) into the function. This minimum value must be less than or equal to 1 for 1 to be in the range of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n4. **Setting Up the Inequality:** Set up the inequality \\( f\\left(\frac{5}{2}\right) \\leq 1 \\) and solve for \\( c \\). This will give you the maximum value of \\( c \\) such that 1 is in the range of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n5. **Checking the Solution:** After finding the value of \\( c \\), verify that \\( f(x) \\) can indeed take the value 1 by substituting back and ensuring the inequality holds.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
