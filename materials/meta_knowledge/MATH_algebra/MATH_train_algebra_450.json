{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly identify what is being asked. In this case, you need to find the percentage of problems Lacy got correct.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the given information to set up an equation. Here, the total number of problems is \\(5x\\) and the number of problems missed is \\(x\\). Therefore, the number of problems she got correct is \\(5x - x = 4x\\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Percentage:** To find the percentage, use the formula \\(\text{Percentage} = \\left(\frac{\text{Number of correct answers}}{\text{Total number of problems}}\right) \times 100\\). In this case, it would be \\(\\left(\frac{4x}{5x}\right) \times 100\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Fraction:** Simplify the fraction \\(\frac{4x}{5x}\\) to \\(\frac{4}{5}\\) before multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when simplifying fractions and converting to percentages.\n\n6. **Final Verification:** Always double-check that the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
