{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of logarithmic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithmic Properties:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as the change of base formula, \\(\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_k a}{\\log_k b}\\), and the fact that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) implies \\(a = b^c\\).\n\n2. **Exponentiation:** When solving for the variable inside the logarithm, remember to exponentiate both sides of the equation with the base of the logarithm. For example, if \\(\\log_b x = y\\), then \\(x = b^y\\).\n\n3. **Checking Domain:** Ensure that the argument of the logarithm is positive, as logarithms are only defined for positive numbers. Verify that \\(r + 16 > 0\\) before proceeding with the solution.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and exponents, as these can lead to errors if not handled carefully.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the given condition, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving logarithmic equations."}
