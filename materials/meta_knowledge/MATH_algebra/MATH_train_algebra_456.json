{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Geometric Sequence Formula:** Remember the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric sequence: \\( S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Identifying Terms:** Ensure you correctly identify the first term \\( a \\) and the common ratio \\( r \\) of the sequence. For the given sequence, \\( a = \frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( r = \frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Substitute the known values into the sum formula to set up the equation \\( \frac{63}{128} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{1 - (\frac{1}{2})^n}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( n \\):** Isolate \\( (\frac{1}{2})^n \\) and solve for \\( n \\) by taking the logarithm of both sides. Be careful with the properties of logarithms to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and exponents, to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Once you find \\( n \\), verify your solution by substituting \\( n \\) back into the sum formula to ensure the sum matches \\( \frac{63}{128} \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
