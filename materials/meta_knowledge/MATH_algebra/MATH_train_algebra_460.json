{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Evaluation:** Accurately evaluate the function at the given points based on the conditions provided (e.g., \\( f(2) \\) for \\( x > 0 \\), \\( f(0) \\) for \\( x = 0 \\), and \\( f(-2) \\) for \\( x < 0 \\)).\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the function values provided. For example, \\( f(2) = 5 \\) gives \\( 2a + 3 = 5 \\), \\( f(0) = 5 \\) gives \\( b = 5 \\), and \\( f(-2) = -10 \\) gives \\( -2b + c = -10 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Variables:** Solve the system of equations step-by-step to find the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). Ensure that each step is logically consistent and that arithmetic is performed correctly.\n\n4. **Nonnegative Integers:** Remember that \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are nonnegative integers. This constraint can help in verifying the correctness of your solutions.\n\n5. **Summing Values:** Once you have determined \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), sum them to find \\( a + b + c \\). Double-check the summation to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
