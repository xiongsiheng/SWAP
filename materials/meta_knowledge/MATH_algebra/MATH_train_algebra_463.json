{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the degree of the product of transformed polynomials, consider the following:\n\n1. **Degree of Polynomials:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, if \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 4, then \\( f(x) = a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 \\).\n\n2. **Degree of a Product:** The degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees. For instance, if \\( f(x) \\) has degree \\( m \\) and \\( g(x) \\) has degree \\( n \\), then \\( f(x) \\cdot g(x) \\) has degree \\( m + n \\).\n\n3. **Degree of Transformed Polynomials:** When a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is transformed to \\( f(x^k) \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer, the degree of the polynomial becomes \\( k \times \text{degree of } f(x) \\). For example, if \\( f(x) \\) has degree 4, then \\( f(x^3) \\) has degree \\( 3 \times 4 = 12 \\).\n\n4. **Combining Transformations:** When dealing with the product of transformed polynomials, apply the transformation rules to each polynomial separately and then combine the results. For instance, if \\( f(x) \\) has degree 4 and \\( g(x) \\) has degree 5, then the degree of \\( f(x^3) \\cdot g(x^2) \\) is calculated by finding the degree of \\( f(x^3) \\) and \\( g(x^2) \\) separately and then summing these degrees.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that you have correctly applied the degree rules for both polynomials and their transformations. This step is crucial to avoid miscalculations.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can minimize errors when determining the degree of complex polynomial expressions."}
