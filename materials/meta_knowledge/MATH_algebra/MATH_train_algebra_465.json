{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for \\( r \\) in this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Exponent Rules:** Understand and apply the rules of exponents correctly. For example, if you have \\( a^m = a^n \\), then \\( m = n \\) provided \\( a \neq 0 \\).\n\n2. **Logarithms:** If necessary, logarithms can be used to solve for an unknown exponent. However, in this case, comparing exponents directly is simpler.\n\n3. **Simplification:** Simplify the equation step by step. Start by expressing both sides with the same base if possible.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with fractions or decimals.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the calculated value of \\( r \\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to ensure the solution is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( r \\) in this type of problem."}
