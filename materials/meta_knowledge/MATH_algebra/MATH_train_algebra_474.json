{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly translate the problem into mathematical equations. For this problem, you should have two equations: one representing the sum of the numbers and the other representing the operation involving the larger and smaller numbers.\n\n2. **Identifying Variables:** Clearly define your variables. For instance, let \\( x \\) be the larger number and \\( y \\) be the smaller number.\n\n3. **Solving Systems of Equations:** Use appropriate methods to solve the system of equations (e.g., substitution or elimination). Be careful with algebraic manipulations to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:** When finding the positive difference between the two numbers, ensure you subtract the smaller number from the larger number to get a positive result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
