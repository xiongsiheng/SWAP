{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Values:** Remember that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. For a function \\( f(x) \\), \\( |f(x)| \\) equals \\( f(x) \\) if \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) and equals \\( -f(x) \\) if \\( f(x) < 0 \\).\n\n2. **Prime Number Properties:** Recall that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Ensure that any candidate number you consider fits this definition.\n\n3. **Quadratic Functions:** Be familiar with the behavior of quadratic functions, including their graphs (parabolas), vertex, and roots. This helps in understanding where the function might yield prime values.\n\n4. **Checking Ranges:** Since the quadratic expression \\( 6x^2 - 47x + 15 \\) can yield both positive and negative values, consider both scenarios where the absolute value simplifies to the original expression or its negation.\n\n5. **Efficient Testing:** Test integer values systematically, starting from the largest possible integer downwards. This helps in quickly identifying the greatest integer that satisfies the condition.\n\n6. **Verification:** After identifying a potential solution, verify it by substituting it back into the expression and checking if the result is indeed a prime number.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
