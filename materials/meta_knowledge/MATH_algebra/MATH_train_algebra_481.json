{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Inequality Manipulation:** When you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must reverse the inequality sign. This is a common mistake to watch out for.\n\n2. **Solving Quadratic Inequalities:** To solve quadratic inequalities like \\(x^2 - 2x > 35\\), first rewrite the inequality in standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c > 0\\), then find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n3. **Determining the Interval:** Once you have the roots, use them to determine the intervals to test. The quadratic expression will be positive outside the interval defined by the roots and negative inside that interval.\n\n4. **Testing Intervals:** Choose test points in each interval determined by the roots to determine where the inequality holds True. This helps in accurately expressing the solution in interval notation.\n\n5. **Interval Notation:** Express the solution in interval notation correctly, ensuring that you include or exclude endpoints based on whether they satisfy the inequality. Use parentheses for excluded endpoints and brackets for included endpoints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
