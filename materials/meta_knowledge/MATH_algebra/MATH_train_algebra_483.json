{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Clearing Fractions:** When dealing with equations involving fractions, clearing the fractions by multiplying through by a common denominator can simplify the equation.\n\n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** For equations of the form \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\), cross-multiplying (i.e., \\(ad = bc\\)) can be a useful technique to eliminate fractions.\n\n3. **Quadratic Equations:** Recognize when you have a quadratic equation and use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots.\n\n4. **Simplifying Expressions:** Ensure that you simplify expressions correctly, especially when dealing with square roots and rational expressions. For example, \\(\\frac{a + b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\\) should be simplified to its most basic form.\n\n5. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, check whether the solutions satisfy the original equation, as operations like squaring or multiplying through by a variable can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\n6. **Integer Constraints:** Be aware of the constraints that \\(a, b, c, d\\) are integers, which can help in simplifying and verifying the solution.\n\n7. **Maximizing Values:** When asked for the largest possible value of \\(x\\), consider the implications of the coefficients and the nature of the quadratic equation in determining the maximum value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
