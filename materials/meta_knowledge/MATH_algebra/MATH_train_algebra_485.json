{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Powers:** When dealing with equations involving powers, simplify the expressions by using properties of exponents. For example, \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\) and \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\).\n\n2. **Equating Bases:** If two expressions are equal and have the same base raised to different powers, the exponents must be equal. For example, if \\(a^m = a^n\\), then \\(m = n\\).\n\n3. **Isolating Variables:** Isolate the variable by dividing or multiplying both sides of the equation by the same term to simplify the equation.\n\n4. **Checking for Non-Zero Solutions:** Ensure that the solution for the variable is non-zero when specified, as zero might not satisfy the original conditions of the problem.\n\n5. **Fractional Expressions:** When expressing the answer as a common fraction, ensure that the fraction is in its simplest form by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
