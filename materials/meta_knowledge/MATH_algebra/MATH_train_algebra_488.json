{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Revenue:** Revenue is calculated as the product of the price per unit and the number of units sold. In this case, revenue \\( R \\) is given by \\( R = p \times (130 - 5p) \\).\n\n2. **Maximizing Revenue:** To find the price that maximizes revenue, you need to find the maximum value of the revenue function. This typically involves finding the vertex of a quadratic function.\n\n3. **Quadratic Functions:** A quadratic function of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) reaches its maximum (if \\( a < 0 \\)) at \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\). Apply this formula to the revenue function after expressing it in the standard quadratic form.\n\n4. **Domain Considerations:** Ensure that the price \\( p \\) does not exceed the given constraint \\( p \\le 26 \\). This is crucial when interpreting the results of your calculations.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the optimal price, verify that it indeed maximizes revenue by checking the revenue values at slightly lower and higher prices around the calculated optimal price.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
