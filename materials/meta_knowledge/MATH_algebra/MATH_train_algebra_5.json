{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the values of \\( y \\) for which a rational expression is undefined, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Denominator:** The expression is undefined where the denominator is zero. Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** For a quadratic equation of the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), use the quadratic formula \\( y = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the roots. Alternatively, factor the quadratic if possible.\n\n3. **Sum of Roots:** If you need to find the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation, remember that for \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is given by \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n4. **Avoid Common Errors:** Be cautious with signs and arithmetic when solving for \\( y \\). Double-check your factorization or use of the quadratic formula to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Although not always necessary for this type of problem, it can be helpful to verify that setting the roots back into the original expression does indeed make the denominator zero.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for the values of \\( y \\) that make the expression undefined."}
