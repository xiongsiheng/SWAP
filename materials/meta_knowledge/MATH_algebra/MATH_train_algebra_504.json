{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the other value of \\( x \\) in a quadratic equation, consider the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the standard form of the quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Substitution and Verification:** Since you know one solution, substitute \\( x = \frac{5}{7} \\) into the equation to verify it satisfies the equation. This step confirms the equation is correctly set up.\n\n3. **Forming the Quadratic Equation:** Rearrange the given equation into the standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). This helps in applying the quadratic formula correctly.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After finding the other root using the quadratic formula, substitute both roots back into the original equation to ensure they are not extraneous.\n\n5. **Simplification:** Be meticulous in simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving quadratic equations."}
