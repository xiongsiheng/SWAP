{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving quadratic equations like this one, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients from the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Discriminant Check:** Before applying the quadratic formula, calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to ensure there are real solutions. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\n3. **Simplifying Roots:** When simplifying the square root in the quadratic formula, ensure you factorize the expression under the square root to its simplest form.\n\n4. **Fraction Simplification:** After finding the solutions, simplify the resulting fractions to their lowest terms. Use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the numerator and the denominator.\n\n5. **Positive Solution Check:** Since the problem specifies \\(x > 0\\), ensure you only consider and report the positive solution.\n\n6. **Substitution Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to confirm it satisfies the equation, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations."}
