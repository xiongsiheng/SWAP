{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series:** The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series with first term \\( a \\) and common ratio \\( r \\) (where \\( |r| < 1 \\)) is given by \\( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \\).\n\n2. **Finding the First Term:** Use the sum formula to solve for the first term \\( a \\) given the sum \\( S \\) and the common ratio \\( r \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Second Term:** Once you have the first term \\( a \\), the second term of the sequence can be found by multiplying the first term by the common ratio \\( r \\), i.e., \\( ar \\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and negative numbers, to avoid common arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations by ensuring that the sum of the series, using the first term and common ratio you found, matches the given sum of 25.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
