{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the constant \\( c \\) in a parabola equation given points it passes through, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Substitute the coordinates of the given points into the equation of the parabola to form a system of equations. For example, substituting \\( (2, 3) \\) into \\( y = x^2 + bx + c \\) gives \\( 3 = 2^2 + 2b + c \\).\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Use the two resulting equations from the substitutions to solve for the coefficients \\( b \\) and \\( c \\). Ensure that you correctly isolate and solve for one variable at a time, typically starting with \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to your arithmetic operations, especially when simplifying expressions or solving for variables. Errors in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can lead to incorrect values for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Verification:** Once you find \\( c \\), substitute it back into the equations formed by the points to verify that both equations hold True. This step ensures that your solution is correct and that no arithmetic mistakes were made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( c \\) in the given problem."}
