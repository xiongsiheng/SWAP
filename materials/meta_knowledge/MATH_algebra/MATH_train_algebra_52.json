{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the tree's height doubles every year, which is an example of exponential growth. This means the height at any given year can be calculated by repeatedly multiplying by 2.\n\n2. **Working Backwards:** Since the tree's height doubles each year, you can work backwards from the known height at the end of 6 years by dividing by 2 for each year you go back.\n\n3. **Calculating Intermediate Values:** To find the height at the end of 3 years, you need to calculate the height at the end of 4 years, then 5 years, and finally 6 years, each time dividing by 2.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you perform each division correctly and verify the calculations to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** Ensure that your final answer makes logical sense in the context of the problem, i.e., the height should be less than 32 feet and should be a reasonable value given the doubling pattern.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
