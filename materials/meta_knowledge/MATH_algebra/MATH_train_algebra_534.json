{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Scoring System:** Clearly understand the scoring system for correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions. In this case, 6 points for correct, 0 points for incorrect, and 1.5 points for unanswered.\n\n2. **Calculating Points for Unanswered Questions:** First, calculate the total points Sarah will receive from the unanswered questions. Multiply the number of unanswered questions by the points awarded per unanswered question.\n\n3. **Setting Up an Equation:** To find out how many correct answers Sarah needs, set up an equation where the total points from correct answers plus the points from unanswered questions equals the desired score (100 points in this case).\n\n4. **Solving for the Number of Correct Answers:** Isolate the variable representing the number of correct answers and solve the equation. Ensure you perform all arithmetic operations accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the number of correct answers you found, when combined with the points from unanswered questions, indeed reaches the desired score.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
