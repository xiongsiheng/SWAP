{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the bacteria are growing exponentially, meaning the number of bacteria doubles at regular intervals. This can be modeled using the formula \\( N = N_0 \times 2^{t/T} \\), where \\( N \\) is the final number of bacteria, \\( N_0 \\) is the initial number of bacteria, \\( t \\) is the time elapsed, and \\( T \\) is the doubling time.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Substitute the given values into the exponential growth formula to set up the equation correctly. For this problem, \\( N_0 = 500 \\), \\( N = 32,000 \\), and \\( T = 4 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Solving for Time:** Isolate the variable \\( t \\) by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation. This step is crucial to find the exact time required for the bacteria to reach the specified number.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and logarithms, as these can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by substituting the calculated time back into the original equation to ensure the number of bacteria matches the expected value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving exponential growth."}
