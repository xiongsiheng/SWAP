{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating this expression, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor 12.1 \\rfloor = 12\\).\n\n2. **Squaring Numbers:** When squaring a number, ensure you use the correct decimal or fractional part. For instance, \\((12.1)^2 = 146.41\\).\n\n3. **Applying Floor Function to Results:** After calculating \\((12.1)^2\\), apply the floor function to the result. For \\(146.41\\), \\(\\lfloor 146.41 \\rfloor = 146\\).\n\n4. **Performing Integer Arithmetic:** When multiplying \\(\\lfloor 12.1 \\rfloor\\) by itself, remember it involves only integers. Thus, \\(12 \\times 12 = 144\\).\n\n5. **Subtracting Results:** Finally, subtract the integer results obtained from the floor functions. Ensure you are subtracting the correct values to get the final answer.\n\nBy following these steps carefully, you can minimize errors in evaluating such expressions."}
