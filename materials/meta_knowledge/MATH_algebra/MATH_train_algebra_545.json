{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the product of the slope and y-intercept (mb) of a line given its graph, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Slope (m):** The slope of a line is determined by the change in y over the change in x between any two points on the line. Use the formula \\(m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\). Ensure you correctly count the units on the grid.\n\n2. **Determine the y-Intercept (b):** The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. It is the value of y when x is 0. Look for this point on the graph and note its y-coordinate.\n\n3. **Calculate mb:** Multiply the slope (m) by the y-intercept (b) to find mb. Ensure you perform this multiplication accurately.\n\n4. **Double-Check Coordinates:** Verify the coordinates of points used to calculate the slope and the y-intercept to avoid misreading the graph.\n\n5. **Graph Accuracy:** Ensure the graph is read correctly and that the line's direction and intersections with the axes are accurately interpreted.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
