{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Difference of Squares:** Recognize that expressions like \\(a^2 - b^2\\) can be factored as \\((a - b)(a + b)\\). This can simplify the calculation significantly.\n\n2. **Pairing Terms:** Consider pairing terms strategically to simplify the calculation. For example, pairing \\(19^2 - 17^2\\), \\(15^2 - 13^2\\), and so on, can leverage the difference of squares formula.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that you perform each arithmetic operation accurately, especially when dealing with large numbers or multiple steps.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** After completing the calculation, it can be helpful to double-check each step to catch any arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Using Calculators Wisely:** If using a calculator, ensure that you input each step correctly to avoid errors due to miskeying.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
