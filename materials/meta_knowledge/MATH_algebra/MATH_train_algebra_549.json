{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Inequality:** Recognize that \\((x+3)^2\\) represents a square of a binomial, which is always nonnegative. Therefore, \\((x+3)^2\\) can only be less than or equal to 1 if it equals 0 or 1.\n\n2. **Solving the Equation:** Set up the equation \\((x+3)^2 = 1\\) and solve for x. This involves taking the square root of both sides, which gives two possible equations: \\(x+3 = 1\\) and \\(x+3 = -1\\).\n\n3. **Finding Integer Solutions:** Solve each equation for x and check if the solutions are integers. This step ensures you only consider valid integer values.\n\n4. **Checking the Inequality:** Verify that the solutions satisfy the original inequality \\((x+3)^2 \\leq 1\\) to ensure they are valid.\n\n5. **Counting Solutions:** Count the number of valid integer solutions to determine the final answer.\n\nThese steps help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when solving inequalities involving squares of binomials."}
