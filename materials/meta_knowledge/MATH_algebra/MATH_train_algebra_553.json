{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:** Recognize that the number of canoes built each month forms a geometric sequence, where each term is twice the previous term.\n\n2. **Sum of Geometric Series:** To find the total number of canoes built by the end of May, you need to sum the terms of the geometric series. The formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is \\( S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term, \\( r \\) is the common ratio, and \\( n \\) is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Correct Term Calculation:** Ensure you correctly calculate the number of terms from January to May (inclusive), which is 5 terms.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Multiplication and Division:** Be precise when calculating powers of the common ratio (2 in this case) and when applying the sum formula, as these steps are critical to obtaining the correct total.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your calculations by manually summing the terms to ensure the formula was applied correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
