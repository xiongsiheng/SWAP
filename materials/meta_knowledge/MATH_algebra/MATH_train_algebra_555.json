{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Transformations:** Understand how transformations affect the graph of a function. For example, scaling the input (multiplying \\(x\\) by a constant) or the output (multiplying \\(y\\) by a constant) changes the position of points on the graph.\n\n2. **Substitution and Calculation:** When given a point on the original graph, substitute the \\(x\\)-coordinate into the transformed function and solve for the new \\(y\\)-coordinate. Ensure accurate substitution and calculation to find the correct point.\n\n3. **Coordinate Sum:** After finding the new point, add its coordinates together carefully to get the final answer. Pay attention to both the arithmetic and the signs of the coordinates.\n\n4. **Double-Check Work:** Verify your calculations by re-checking the substitution and arithmetic steps to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
