{"Knowledge": "To find the minimum value of a quadratic function like \\( y = x^2 + 12x + 5 \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form:** A quadratic function \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) reaches its minimum (or maximum) value at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n2. **Completing the Square:** Alternatively, you can complete the square to rewrite the quadratic function in vertex form, which directly gives you the minimum value.\n\n3. **Derivative:** For more advanced methods, you can find the derivative of the function and set it to zero to find the critical points, then determine which of these gives the minimum value.\n\n4. **Graphical Understanding:** Understanding that the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola that opens upwards (if \\( a > 0 \\)) helps visualize where the minimum point is.\n\n5. **Substitution and Verification:** Once you find the minimum value, substitute the corresponding \\( x \\) value back into the original equation to verify that it indeed gives the minimum \\( y \\).\n\nThese strategies help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when determining the minimum value of a quadratic function."}
