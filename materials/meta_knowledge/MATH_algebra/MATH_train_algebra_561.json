{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like \\(36 - 9x^2\\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Recognize the Form:** Identify if the expression is a difference of squares, which typically takes the form \\(a^2 - b^2\\). In this case, \\(36\\) is \\(6^2\\) and \\(9x^2\\) is \\((3x)^2\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Difference of Squares Formula:** Use the formula \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). For \\(36 - 9x^2\\), this translates to \\((6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)\\).\n\n3. **Check for Common Factors:** Before applying the difference of squares, check if each term in the expression has a common factor that can be factored out. Here, both \\(36\\) and \\(9x^2\\) are divisible by \\(9\\), so factor out \\(9\\) first: \\(9(4 - x^2)\\), then apply the difference of squares to \\(4 - x^2\\).\n\n4. **Verify the Factoring:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure they correctly reproduce the original expression.\n\n5. **Simplify Completely:** Ensure that the factored form is in its simplest terms. In this case, the final factored form should be \\(9(2 - x)(2 + x)\\).\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when factoring such expressions."}
