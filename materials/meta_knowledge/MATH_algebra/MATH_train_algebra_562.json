{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factoring Quadratics:** Ensure that you factor the quadratic expression correctly. For the given problem, \\(a^2 - 10a + 21\\) can be factored into \\((a - 3)(a - 7)\\).\n\n2. **Understanding Inequalities:** When solving inequalities, the direction of the inequality sign can change when multiplying or dividing by a negative number. However, since this is a quadratic inequality, focus on finding the roots and determining the intervals where the expression is non-positive.\n\n3. **Critical Points:** Identify the critical points by setting the quadratic expression equal to zero. For \\(a^2 - 10a + 21 = 0\\), the roots are \\(a = 3\\) and \\(a = 7\\). These points divide the number line into intervals.\n\n4. **Testing Intervals:** Test the sign of the quadratic expression in each interval determined by the critical points. This helps in identifying where the inequality \\(a^2 - 10a + 21 \\leq 0\\) holds True.\n\n5. **Maximizing Value:** To find the greatest value of \\(a\\) that satisfies the inequality, consider the upper bound of the interval where the inequality holds. In this case, it would be the largest root of the quadratic equation.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the potential maximum value back into the inequality to confirm it satisfies the condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
