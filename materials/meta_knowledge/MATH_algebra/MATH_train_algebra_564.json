{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of optimization problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:** Clearly identify the dimensions of the rectangle involved. In this case, one side is given (400 feet), and you need to find the length of the opposite side to maximize the area.\n\n2. **Cost and Length Relationship:** Establish the relationship between the total cost of the fence and the lengths of the sides. Since the fence costs $5 per foot and the total cost is $1,200, you can determine the total length of the fence used.\n\n3. **Formulating the Area Function:** Express the area of the rectangle in terms of one variable. This involves setting up the equation for the area (length times width) and substituting the known values and relationships.\n\n4. **Differentiation for Optimization:** Use calculus to find the maximum area. This typically involves taking the derivative of the area function with respect to the variable, setting it to zero, and solving for the variable.\n\n5. **Checking Critical Points:** Verify that the critical point found is indeed a maximum by using the second derivative test or by evaluating the area at endpoints if applicable.\n\n6. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail in all calculations, especially when differentiating and solving algebraic equations, as errors at this stage can significantly impact the final answer.\n\n7. **Unit Consistency:** Ensure all units are consistent throughout the problem, converting where necessary to maintain accuracy in the final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such optimization problems."}
