{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Fractions:** Start by simplifying the fraction on the left side of the equation. For example, \\(\\frac{30}{50}\\) can be simplified to \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\n2. **Squaring Both Sides:** To eliminate the square root, square both sides of the equation. This will help in isolating the variable.\n\n3. **Isolating the Variable:** Once the square root is removed, solve for the variable \\(y\\) by performing the necessary arithmetic operations.\n\n4. **Double-Check Arithmetic:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, as these operations can be prone to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the calculated value of \\(y\\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step is crucial to ensure the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
