{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of logarithmic problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Logarithm Properties:** Familiarize yourself with the properties of logarithms, such as the change of base formula \\(\\log_{a}b = \\frac{\\log_{c}b}{\\log_{c}a}\\), which is crucial for changing the base of logarithms.\n\n2. **Base Conversion:** Understand how to convert logarithms from one base to another using the change of base formula. This is essential for relating \\(\\log_{4}3\\) to \\(\\log_{2}27\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** Be meticulous when simplifying logarithmic expressions. For example, \\(\\log_{2}27\\) can be expressed as \\(\\log_{2}(3^3)\\), which simplifies using the power rule of logarithms.\n\n4. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution methods wisely to eliminate variables and solve for the unknown. In this case, substitute \\(x\\) from the first logarithmic equation into the second one.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the value of \\(k\\), verify your solution by substituting back into the original expressions to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving logarithmic problems."}
