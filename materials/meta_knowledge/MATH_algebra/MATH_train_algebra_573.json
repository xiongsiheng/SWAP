{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for expressions involving complex numbers, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Complex Number Operations:** Understand how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide complex numbers. For example, addition and subtraction are done by adding or subtracting the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:** Use the distributive property correctly when multiplying complex numbers. For instance, \\((a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\\).\n\n3. **Simplification:** Simplify expressions by combining like terms, both real and imaginary parts, after performing operations.\n\n4. **Conjugates:** If needed, use the conjugate of a complex number to simplify expressions, especially when dealing with division.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating, verify the result by substituting the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) back into the expression to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while working with complex numbers in algebraic expressions."}
