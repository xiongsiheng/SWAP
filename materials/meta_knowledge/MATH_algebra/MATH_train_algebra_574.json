{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the product of the roots of a quadratic equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:** For a quadratic equation of the form \\(at^2 + bt + c = 0\\), the product of the roots can be directly found using Vieta's formulas, which state that the product of the roots is \\(\frac{c}{a}\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient Identification:** Identify the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) correctly from the given quadratic equation. In this case, \\(a = 18\\), \\(b = 45\\), and \\(c = -500\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform the division \\(\frac{c}{a}\\) accurately to avoid computational errors. In this problem, the product of the roots is \\(\frac{-500}{18}\\).\n\n4. **Simplification:** Simplify the fraction \\(\frac{-500}{18}\\) to its lowest terms if necessary, by finding the greatest common divisor of 500 and 18.\n\n5. **Sign Convention:** Remember that the product of the roots is given by the ratio of the constant term \\(c\\) to the coefficient \\(a\\), and it retains the sign of \\(c\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the product of the roots of a quadratic equation."}
