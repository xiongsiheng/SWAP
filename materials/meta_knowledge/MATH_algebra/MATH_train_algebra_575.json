{"Knowledge": "To determine the domain of a function, especially one involving a square root in the denominator, consider the following:\n\n1. **Non-Negative Radicands:** For square roots to be defined in the real numbers, the expression inside the square root (the radicand) must be non-negative. Therefore, \\(x \\geq 0\\).\n\n2. **Non-Zero Denominators:** Since the function includes a square root in the denominator, the denominator cannot be zero. This means \\(x > 0\\).\n\n3. **Combining Conditions:** Combine the conditions from the radicand and the denominator to find the domain. Here, \\(x > 0\\) ensures both that the square root is defined and that the denominator is not zero.\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** Express the domain in interval notation, which for \\(x > 0\\) is \\((0, \\infty)\\).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can accurately determine the domain of functions involving square roots in the denominator."}
