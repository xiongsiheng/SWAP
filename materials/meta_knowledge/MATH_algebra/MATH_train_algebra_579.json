{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Reciprocals:** Recognize that the equation \\(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\\) implies a relationship between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) where the sum of their reciprocals equals 1. This is a key property in harmonic means and can be used to derive further relationships.\n\n2. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution methods to replace variables in equations. For instance, you can express \\(q\\) in terms of \\(p\\) using the equation \\(pq = 4\\), and then substitute this into the first equation.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Be proficient in solving quadratic equations, as you might need to solve for \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) in the form of a quadratic equation. Remember the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\).\n\n4. **Checking Domain Constraints:** Always check that the solutions satisfy the initial conditions (e.g., \\(p > 1\\) and \\(q > 1\\)). Solutions that do not meet these constraints are extraneous.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute your final answer back into both original equations to ensure it satisfies both conditions, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
