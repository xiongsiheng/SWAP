{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction involving square roots, consider the following:\n\n1. **Conjugate Multiplication:** When the denominator is a difference of square roots (like \\(\\sqrt{a} - \\(\\sqrt{b}\\)), multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\(\\sqrt{b}\\)). This will eliminate the square roots in the denominator.\n\n2. **Simplifying Products of Radicals:** When multiplying radicals, use the property \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}\\) to simplify. Ensure that you correctly combine and simplify the terms.\n\n3. **Distributing Correctly:** When distributing in the numerator after multiplying by the conjugate, be meticulous to distribute each term correctly to avoid algebraic errors.\n\n4. **Reducing Fractions:** After rationalizing, simplify the fraction by factoring out common terms in the numerator and denominator and canceling them out.\n\n5. **Checking Integer Conditions:** Ensure that the final form of the fraction meets the specified conditions (e.g., integers for A, B, C, D, and B not divisible by the square of any prime). Verify that the values are minimized as required.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure the correctness of your solution."}
