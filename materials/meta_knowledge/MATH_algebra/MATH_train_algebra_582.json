{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Representation:** Ensure you correctly interpret the function given. In this case, \\( f(x) = ax + bx + 2 \\) should be simplified to \\( f(x) = (a + b)x + 2 \\) to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Use the given values of the function to set up a system of equations. For example, using \\( f(1) = 5 \\) and \\( f(2) = 8 \\), you can form equations to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Coefficients:** Solve the system of equations accurately to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). This step requires careful handling of algebraic manipulations to avoid calculation errors.\n\n4. **Substitution:** Once you have determined the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), substitute these into the function to find \\( f(3) \\). Ensure you substitute correctly and perform the arithmetic accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by checking if the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) satisfy the original function values \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(2) \\). This step can help confirm the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
