{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Clearing the Fraction:** When dealing with a rational equation, one common approach is to multiply both sides by the denominator to clear the fraction. However, this can introduce extraneous solutions if the denominator becomes zero. Always check for values that make the denominator zero and exclude them from possible solutions.\n\n2. **Expanding and Simplifying:** After clearing the fraction, expand both sides of the equation and combine like terms. Ensure that you correctly distribute and combine terms to avoid algebraic errors.\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Once you have a quadratic equation, solve it using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. Be meticulous in your calculations to avoid arithmetic mistakes.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** Substitute your solutions back into the original equation to verify they satisfy the equation. This step is crucial to identify and eliminate any extraneous solutions that may have been introduced during the solving process.\n\n5. **Domain Considerations:** Consider the domain of the original rational function. Any value of \\(x\\) that makes the denominator zero is not a valid solution. Ensure your final solutions are within the domain of the original equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
