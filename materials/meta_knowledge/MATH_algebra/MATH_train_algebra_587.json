{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the given conditions. In this case, you have two equations: \\( x + y = 399 \\) and \\( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \\).\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** Use the substitution method to solve for one variable in terms of the other. For example, from \\( \frac{x}{y} = 0.9 \\), you can express \\( x \\) as \\( 0.9y \\).\n\n3. **Check Calculations:** When substituting and solving, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with decimal fractions.\n\n4. **Final Verification:** After finding the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), verify that they satisfy both original equations to ensure correctness.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Operations:** Be meticulous with arithmetic operations, particularly when subtracting \\( x \\) from \\( y \\) to find \\( y - x \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
