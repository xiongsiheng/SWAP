{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving systems of linear equations, consider the following:\n\n1. **Elimination Method:** When using the elimination method, ensure you multiply the entire equation correctly to align coefficients for easy subtraction or addition. Missteps in multiplication can lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** If using substitution, isolate one variable accurately before substituting into the other equation. Incorrect isolation can distort the solution.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations during both elimination and substitution. Simple arithmetic errors can significantly affect the outcome.\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After finding the values of the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify their correctness. This step helps catch any errors made during the solving process.\n\n5. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand what the problem is asking for. In this case, ensure you correctly calculate \\(a + b\\) after solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) individually.\n\nThese guidelines will help minimize errors and ensure accurate solutions to systems of linear equations."}
