{"Knowledge": "To determine the value of \\(a\\) that makes the piecewise function continuous, consider the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Continuity:** A function is continuous at a point if the limit of the function as \\(x\\) approaches that point from both sides is equal to the function's value at that point.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Piecewise Function:** For the function \\(f(x)\\) to be continuous at \\(x = 3\\), the left-hand limit (as \\(x\\) approaches 3 from the left) must equal the right-hand limit (as \\(x\\) approaches 3 from the right), and both must equal \\(f(3).\\)\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Calculate the function values on both sides of \\(x = 3\\):\n   - For \\(x > 3\\), \\(f(x) = x + 2\\). Therefore, \\(f(3^+) = 3 + 2 = 5\\).\n   - For \\(x \\leq 3\\), \\(f(x) = 2x + a\\). Therefore, \\(f(3^-) = 2(3) + a = 6 + a\\).\n\n4. **Equating the Limits:** To ensure continuity at \\(x = 3\\), set \\(f(3^-) = f(3^+)\\), which gives \\(6 + a = 5\\).\n\n5. **Solving for \\(a\\):** Solve the equation \\(6 + a = 5\\) to find \\(a = 5 - 6 = -1\\).\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the value of \\(a\\) that makes the function continuous."}
