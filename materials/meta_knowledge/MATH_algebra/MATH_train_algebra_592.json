{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:** Recognize that the number of cans in each row forms an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. In this case, the difference is 2 cans per row.\n\n2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Series:** The total number of cans is the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic series is \\( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term, \\( l \\) is the last term, and \\( n \\) is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the given total number of cans (100) to set up an equation involving \\( n \\). For this problem, the first term \\( a \\) is 1 (since the top row has 1 can), and the \\( n \\)-th term \\( l \\) can be expressed as \\( 1 + 2(n-1) \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( n \\):** Substitute the known values into the sum formula and solve for \\( n \\). This involves algebraic manipulation to isolate \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Checking the Solution:** After finding \\( n \\), verify by calculating the total number of cans using the arithmetic series formula to ensure it matches the given total of 100 cans.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
