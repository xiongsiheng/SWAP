{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like \\( t^2 - 121 \\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognize the Difference of Squares:** Identify if the expression is a difference of squares, which has the form \\( a^2 - b^2 \\). In this case, \\( t^2 - 121 \\) fits this pattern where \\( t^2 \\) is \\( a^2 \\) and \\( 121 \\) is \\( b^2 \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Difference of Squares Formula:** Use the formula \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\). For \\( t^2 - 121 \\), \\( a = t \\) and \\( b = 11 \\) (since \\( 121 = 11^2 \\)).\n\n3. **Check Your Work:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure they correctly reproduce the original expression. This step helps verify the accuracy of your factorization.\n\n4. **Be Mindful of Signs:** Ensure that the signs in your factors are correct. A common error is flipping the signs, leading to incorrect factors.\n\n5. **Simplify Completely:** Make sure your factored form is in its simplest and most reduced state. For example, ensure there are no common factors within each binomial that could be further simplified.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while factoring such problems."}
