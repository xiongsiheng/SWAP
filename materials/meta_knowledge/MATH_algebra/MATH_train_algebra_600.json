{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving geometric sequences, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences:** Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. For a sequence \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots\\), if the common ratio is \\(r\\), then \\(a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r\\) and \\(a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^2\\).\n\n2. **Identifying Common Ratios:** In the problem, you are given two geometric sequences with different common ratios. Denote the common ratio of the first sequence as \\(r_1\\) and the second sequence as \\(r_2\\).\n\n3. **Using Given Information:** Utilize the given equation \\(a_3 - b_3 = 3(a_2 - b_2)\\) to relate the terms of the sequences. Express \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\) in terms of their respective first terms and common ratios.\n\n4. **Solving for Ratios:** Substitute the expressions for \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\) into the given equation and solve for \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\). This step involves algebraic manipulation and simplification.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the common ratios, verify that they satisfy the original equation to ensure correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving geometric sequences."}
