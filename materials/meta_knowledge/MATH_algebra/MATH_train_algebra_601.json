{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the intersection points of two parabolas, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Set Equations Equal:** To find where the parabolas intersect, set their equations equal to each other: \\(3x^2 + 4x - 5 = x^2 + 11\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the Equation:** Combine like terms to simplify the resulting equation. Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\n3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** Use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) or factor the equation to solve for \\(x\\). Ensure you correctly identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) from the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Find Corresponding \\(y\\)-Values:** Substitute each \\(x\\)-value back into either original equation to find the corresponding \\(y\\)-values.\n\n5. **Check for Accuracy:** Verify that the points you find satisfy both original equations to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Order Points Correctly:** List the points in order of increasing \\(x\\)-coordinate as required.\n\nThese steps will help ensure you correctly find and list the intersection points of the parabolas."}
