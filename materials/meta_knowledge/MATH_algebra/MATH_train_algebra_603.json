{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Slope-Intercept Form:** Recall that the equation of a line in slope-intercept form is \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Intercepts and Equations:** Recognize that the x-intercept of a line occurs when \\( y = 0 \\). For a line with slope \\( m \\) and y-intercept \\( b \\), the x-intercept can be found by setting \\( y = 0 \\) and solving for \\( x \\), resulting in \\( x = -\frac{b}{m} \\).\n\n3. **Ratio Calculation:** When finding the ratio of two quantities, ensure that you are comparing them directly. For example, if you need the ratio of \\( s \\) to \\( t \\), express it as \\( \frac{s}{t} \\).\n\n4. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure that all calculations are consistent in terms of units and dimensions. Since slopes and intercepts are in the same units (typically units of length), direct comparison is valid.\n\n5. **Simplification of Fractions:** When expressing a ratio as a fraction, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms to ensure the answer is in its simplest form.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
