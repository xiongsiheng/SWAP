{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given quadratic equation represents a parabolic path where \\( y \\) is the height at time \\( t \\). The equation \\( y = -16t^2 + 22t + 45 \\) is in the standard form \\( y = at^2 + bt + c \\), where \\( a = -16 \\), \\( b = 22 \\), and \\( c = 45 \\).\n\n2. **Setting the Equation to Zero:** To find the time when the ball hits the ground, set \\( y = 0 \\) and solve for \\( t \\). This is because the height \\( y \\) is zero when the ball is on the ground.\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Use the quadratic formula \\( t = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to solve for \\( t \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the equation.\n\n4. **Discriminant Check:** Before solving, calculate the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) to ensure there are real solutions. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions, indicating the ball never hits the ground.\n\n5. **Selecting the Appropriate Solution:** Once you find the solutions for \\( t \\), choose the positive value since time cannot be negative. This represents the actual time when the ball hits the ground.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
