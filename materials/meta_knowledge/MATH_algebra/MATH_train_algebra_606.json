{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Recognizing Geometric Series:** Identify that the given series is a geometric series where each term is a constant multiple of the previous term. In this case, the common ratio is \\(\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Geometric Series Formula:** Use the formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of a geometric series: \\(S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with fractions and exponents, as these can be prone to arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Understanding Convergence:** Recognize that for \\(|r| < 1\\), the series converges, and the sum of an infinite geometric series is given by \\(S = \frac{a}{1-r}\\). This can be applied if the problem extends to an infinite series.\n\n5. **Checking Work:** After calculating the sum, verify the result by manually adding the first few terms to ensure the calculation is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
