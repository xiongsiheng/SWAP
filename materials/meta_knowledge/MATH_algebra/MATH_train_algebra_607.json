{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating overall percentages from multiple tests, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Weighted Average Concept:** Understand that the overall percentage is a weighted average of the individual test scores, where each score is weighted by the number of problems in the test.\n\n2. **Correct Calculation of Total Points:** Calculate the total points earned by multiplying the percentage score by the number of problems for each test, then sum these values.\n\n3. **Total Possible Points:** Sum the total number of problems from all tests to get the total possible points.\n\n4. **Overall Percentage Calculation:** Divide the total points earned by the total possible points and multiply by 100 to get the overall percentage.\n\n5. **Rounding Rules:** Round the final percentage to the nearest whole number using standard rounding rules (round up if the decimal is 0.5 or more, round down if less).\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify all multiplications and additions to ensure accuracy, as errors in these steps can significantly affect the final result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating overall percentages from multiple tests."}
