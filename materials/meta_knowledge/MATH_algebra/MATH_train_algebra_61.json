{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify the given expression as much as possible before proceeding. In this case, simplify \\(\frac{x^4}{x^2}\\) to \\(x^2\\).\n\n2. **Understanding Inequalities:** When dealing with inequalities, remember that multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.\n\n3. **Integer Constraints:** Since the problem asks for the greatest possible positive integer value of \\(x\\), focus on integer solutions and test the boundary values.\n\n4. **Boundary Testing:** Test values around the boundary where the inequality changes from True to False to ensure you find the maximum integer value that satisfies the inequality.\n\n5. **Checking Solutions:** Always verify your solution by substituting it back into the original inequality to confirm it holds True.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
