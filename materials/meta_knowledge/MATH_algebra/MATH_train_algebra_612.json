{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. When evaluating \\(h(x) = f(g(x))\\), first find \\(g(x)\\) and then use that result to find \\(f(g(x))\\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating functions and their compositions. This includes evaluating inside functions first and then applying the outer functions.\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** When dealing with expressions involving square roots, simplify them carefully. Remember that \\(\\sqrt{a + b}\\) is not the same as \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\(\\sqrt{b}\\).\n\n4. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, double-check that you are substituting correctly and that the arithmetic operations are performed accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating \\(h(2)\\), consider verifying the steps by re-evaluating the functions in the reverse order or by checking against known properties of the functions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
