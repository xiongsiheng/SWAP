{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation involving absolute values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Absolute Value:** Recall that the absolute value equation $|A| = B$ can be split into two cases: $A = B$ and $A = -B$. This is crucial for breaking down the problem into manageable parts.\n\n2. **Solving for Each Case:** Solve each case separately. Ensure that you handle the algebraic manipulations correctly, especially when dealing with inequalities or when isolating variables.\n\n3. **Checking for Validity:** After solving each case, check whether the solutions satisfy the original equation. Solutions that do not satisfy the original equation are extraneous and should be discarded.\n\n4. **Simplifying Fractions:** When expressing solutions, simplify fractions to their simplest form. This helps in verifying the correctness of the solution and ensures clarity in the final answer.\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as forgetting to check for extraneous solutions or incorrectly simplifying expressions. Double-checking your work can help catch these errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving equations involving absolute values."}
