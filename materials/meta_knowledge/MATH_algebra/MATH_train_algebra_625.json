{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations accurately. Use variables to represent the ages of James and Louise.\n\n2. **Understanding Time Frames:** Clearly distinguish between 'now', 'eight years from now', and 'four years before now'. Ensure that the ages are correctly adjusted for these time frames.\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When you have multiple equations, solve them step by step, ensuring that each step is logically consistent.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the solution, verify it by substituting the ages back into the original conditions to ensure they satisfy all given statements.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
