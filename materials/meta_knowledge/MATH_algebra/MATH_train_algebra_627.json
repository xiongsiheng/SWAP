{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponential Growth:** Recognize that the amount of money deposited each day follows an exponential growth pattern (doubling each day). This is a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.\n\n2. **Sum of a Geometric Series:** If you need to find the total amount of money deposited over a period, you may need to calculate the sum of a geometric series. The formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is \\( S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n3. **Converting Days to Weeks:** Since the problem involves a two-week period, be aware that there are 7 days in a week. You may need to convert between days and weeks to track the day of the week accurately.\n\n4. **Threshold Crossing:** Determine the point at which the total amount of money exceeds $2. This involves adding up the daily deposits until the cumulative total surpasses the threshold.\n\n5. **Verification of Calculations:** Double-check your calculations for both the daily deposits and the cumulative total to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with large exponents and sums.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
