{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when calculating the length of a segment given its endpoints, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula, which is \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of the endpoints.\n\n2. **Correct Substitution:** Ensure that you correctly substitute the coordinates into the formula, matching the correct x and y values to the respective points.\n\n3. **Order of Subtraction:** The order of subtraction within the formula does not affect the result due to the squaring of differences, but consistency in order helps avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Square Roots:** After calculating the sum of the squares of the differences, take the square root correctly to find the distance. Remember that the square root of a number squared is the absolute value of the number.\n\n5. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, especially squaring and square rooting, to avoid calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while calculating the length of a segment."}
