{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when combining polynomials, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Combining Like Terms:** Identify and combine like terms, which are terms with the same variable raised to the same power. For example, combine all terms with \\(x^2\\), \\(x\\), and the constant terms separately.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations:** Be meticulous with arithmetic operations, especially when adding or subtracting coefficients. A common mistake is to incorrectly add or subtract the coefficients of like terms.\n\n3. **Order of Terms:** Arrange the terms in the polynomial in descending order by degree, starting with the highest power of \\(x\\) and moving to the lowest.\n\n4. **Simplification:** Ensure that the polynomial is fully simplified, with no like terms left uncombined.\n\n5. **Double-Check Work:** After combining the polynomials, double-check your work by ensuring that each term has been correctly added or subtracted, and that the polynomial is in the correct order.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while combining polynomials."}
