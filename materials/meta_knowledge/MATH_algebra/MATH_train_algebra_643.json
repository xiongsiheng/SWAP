{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Define Variables Clearly:** Assign clear and distinct variables to each unknown quantity. For example, let \\( B \\) represent Billy's age and \\( J \\) represent Joe's age.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Accurately:** Translate the problem's conditions into correct mathematical equations. In this case, you should have \\( B = 2J \\) (Billy's age is twice Joe's age) and \\( B + J = 45 \\) (the sum of their ages is 45).\n\n3. **Solve the System of Equations:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve the system of equations accurately. Ensure that you substitute correctly and solve for one variable at a time.\n\n4. **Check Your Solution:** After finding the values of the variables, verify them by substituting back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy both conditions.\n\n5. **Pay Attention to Units:** Ensure that all quantities are in the same units and that the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nThese steps will help you avoid common errors and ensure the accuracy of your solution."}
