{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Section Formula:** Use the section formula to find the coordinates of a point dividing a line segment in a given ratio. The formula for internal division is \\((x, y) = \\left(\\frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}, \\frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n}\\right)\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are the ratios.\n\n2. **Understanding Ratios:** Ensure you correctly interpret the given ratio. In this case, if point \\(C\\) is three times as far from point \\(A\\) as it is from point \\(B\\), the ratio \\(AC:CB\\) is \\(3:1\\).\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry Basics:** Be confident with basic operations in coordinate geometry, such as calculating distances between points and understanding how coordinates change along a line segment.\n\n4. **Substitution and Calculation:** Carefully substitute the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) into the section formula and perform the calculations accurately to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking the distances \\(AC\\) and \\(CB\\) to ensure they match the given ratio.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
