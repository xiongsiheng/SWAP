{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly define what is being asked. In this case, you need to find right triangles with integer leg lengths where the area equals twice the sum of the legs.\n\n2. **Formulating the Equation:** Use the formula for the area of a right triangle (\\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{leg}_1 \\times \\text{leg}_2\\)) and set it equal to twice the sum of the legs (\\(2 \\times (\\text{leg}_1 + \\text{leg}_2)\\)).\n\n3. **Integer Solutions:** Ensure that you are looking for integer solutions for the leg lengths. This often involves checking pairs of integers.\n\n4. **Avoiding Duplicates:** When finding possible areas, make sure to account for and eliminate duplicate areas from different pairs of leg lengths.\n\n5. **Summing Correctly:** Once you have identified all unique areas, sum them accurately. Double-check your summation to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify each solution by checking if the leg lengths indeed form a right triangle and meet the given condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
