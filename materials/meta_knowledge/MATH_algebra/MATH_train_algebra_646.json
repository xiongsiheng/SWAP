{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Fractional Operations:** When dealing with fractions, especially when repeatedly applying them, ensure that you are correctly calculating half of the current number of students at each step.\n\n2. **Sequential Steps:** Perform the calculations step by step, starting from the initial number of students and halving the number at each subsequent stop. This helps in avoiding errors that might occur if you try to calculate the final number in one go.\n\n3. **Double-Check Calculations:** After performing each halving operation, double-check your calculation to ensure accuracy. This is particularly important when dealing with multiple sequential operations.\n\n4. **Use of Parentheses:** When calculating in a calculator or using a formula, use parentheses to ensure that the division is performed correctly before any other operations.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you have the final number of students, consider manually checking the calculation by working backwards from the final number to see if you arrive at the initial number of students.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
