{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the vertex of a parabola given its equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Parabola:** The vertex form of a parabola is \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. For standard form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the vertex can be found using the formula \\( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n2. **Calculating the x-coordinate of the Vertex:** Use the formula \\( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \\) to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. In the given equation \\( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \\), \\( a = -3 \\) and \\( b = -30 \\). Thus, \\( h = -\frac{-30}{2(-3)} = -5 \\).\n\n3. **Finding the y-coordinate of the Vertex:** Substitute \\( h \\) back into the original equation to find \\( k \\). For \\( y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81 \\), substitute \\( x = -5 \\) to get \\( y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81 \\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that you perform arithmetic operations accurately, especially when substituting values back into the equation. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect vertex coordinates.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your calculations by ensuring that the vertex you found satisfies the original equation. This step can help catch any errors in the process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the vertex of a parabola."}
