{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentage Changes:** When dealing with successive percentage changes, remember that the final amount is not simply the sum of the percentages. Instead, each percentage change is applied to the result of the previous change.\n\n2. **Calculating Successive Discounts:** To find the total percentage reduction, calculate the effect of each discount separately and then combine them. For example, if the price is first reduced by 40%, it becomes 60% of the original price. If it is then reduced by another 40%, it becomes 60% of the new price, which is 60% of 60% of the original price.\n\n3. **Using Correct Mathematical Operations:** Ensure you use multiplication to combine the effects of successive discounts, not addition. This is because each discount is a percentage of the remaining amount, not a fixed amount.\n\n4. **Double-Checking Calculations:** After calculating the final price, verify the total percentage reduction by comparing the final price to the original price. This will help catch any arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Avoiding Common Pitfalls:** Be aware that a common mistake is to add the percentages directly (i.e., assuming a 40% discount followed by another 40% discount results in an 80% total discount), which is incorrect. The correct approach is to multiply the factors representing each discount.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving successive percentage changes."}
