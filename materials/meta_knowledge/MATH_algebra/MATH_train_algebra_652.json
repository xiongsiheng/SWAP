{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Infinite Series:** Recognize that the series on the left-hand side are both infinite geometric series. The first series has a common ratio of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and the second series alternates with a common ratio of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Geometric Series:** Recall the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series \\(S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio. Apply this formula correctly to each series.\n\n3. **Multiplication of Series:** When multiplying two infinite series, consider the properties of the series and how the multiplication affects the resulting series. In this case, the product of the two series forms another geometric series.\n\n4. **Identifying the Resulting Series:** After multiplying the series, identify the resulting series on the right-hand side as another geometric series. Determine its first term and common ratio.\n\n5. **Equating Terms:** Equate the terms of the resulting series to the given series on the right-hand side to find the value of \\(x\\). Ensure that the common ratio and the first term match correctly.\n\n6. **Verification:** Substitute the value of \\(x\\) back into the equation to verify that the series match as expected. This step helps confirm the correctness of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
