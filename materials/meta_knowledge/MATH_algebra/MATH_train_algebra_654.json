{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rationalizing the denominator of a fraction, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rationalization:** Rationalizing the denominator involves eliminating square roots from the denominator. This is typically done by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a conjugate or an appropriate expression.\n\n2. **Using Conjugates:** If the denominator is a sum or difference of square roots, multiply by its conjugate (i.e., change the sign between the terms). For example, if the denominator is \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}\\), use \\(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b}\\) as the conjugate.\n\n3. **Simplifying Radicals:** Before rationalizing, simplify any radicals in the denominator. For example, \\(\\sqrt{108}\\) can be simplified to \\(6\\sqrt{3}\\) since \\(108 = 36 \\times 3\\).\n\n4. **Distributing and Combining Like Terms:** After multiplying by the conjugate, distribute and combine like terms in both the numerator and the denominator. This step is crucial for correctly simplifying the expression.\n\n5. **Checking for Common Factors:** After simplifying, check if there are any common factors that can be canceled between the numerator and the denominator to further simplify the fraction.\n\n6. **Final Verification:** Always double-check your final simplified fraction by ensuring that the original and simplified forms are equivalent. This helps catch any errors in the rationalization process.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when rationalizing denominators."}
