{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that $(x-6)^2 = 25$ is a quadratic equation in disguise. It can be rewritten as $(x-6)^2 - 25 = 0$, which is a difference of squares.\n\n2. **Using the Difference of Squares:** Apply the difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\\), where \\(a = x-6\\) and \\(b = 5\\). This will help in factoring the equation correctly.\n\n3. **Solving for x:** Once factored, set each factor equal to zero and solve for \\(x\\). This will give you the individual solutions.\n\n4. **Summing Solutions:** To find the sum of all solutions, simply add the individual solutions together. This step is straightforward but crucial to ensure you get the correct total.\n\n5. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic during each step, especially when expanding, factoring, and summing the solutions, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
