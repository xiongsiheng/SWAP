{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you have a system of equations involving three variables. You can solve for each variable by expressing them in terms of each other.\n\n2. **Multiplication and Division:** Use the given equations to find relationships between the variables. For example, you can divide one equation by another to eliminate a variable.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when dividing or multiplying large numbers, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. **Substitution and Elimination:** Use substitution or elimination methods to solve for individual variables. Ensure that you substitute correctly and eliminate variables systematically.\n\n5. **Summing Variables:** Once you have the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), add them together carefully to find the final answer. Verify that the sum matches the context of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
