{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Diameter:** The diameter of a circle is a line segment that passes through the center and has its endpoints on the circle. The center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter.\n\n2. **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\). Since the center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter, you can use this formula to find the coordinates of the other endpoint.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** If the center of the circle is \\((2, 3)\\) and one endpoint of the diameter is \\((-1, -1)\\), set up the midpoint formula using these coordinates to find the other endpoint.\n\n4. **Solving for Coordinates:** Solve the equations \\(\\frac{-1 + x_2}{2} = 2\\) and \\(\\frac{-1 + y_2}{2} = 3\\) to find \\(x_2\\) and \\(y_2\\), respectively.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations to ensure that the coordinates you find are indeed the other endpoint of the diameter by confirming that the center is the midpoint of the segment connecting the two endpoints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
