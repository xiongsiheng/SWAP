{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Formula:** Ensure you correctly understand and apply the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular prism, which is \\(\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}\\). This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied in three dimensions.\n\n2. **Substitution and Simplification:** When substituting known values into the formula, double-check that you have substituted correctly and that you are simplifying the expression accurately. For example, ensure that \\(l^2\\), \\(w^2\\), and \\(h^2\\) are correctly calculated and summed.\n\n3. **Solving for the Unknown:** When solving for the unknown (in this case, the width \\(w\\)), isolate \\(w^2\\) correctly and then take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root of a number can yield both a positive and a negative value, but in the context of geometric measurements, the positive value is typically the relevant one.\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding the width, substitute it back into the original equation along with the given values for length and height to verify that the calculated diagonal length matches the given diagonal length. This step helps confirm the accuracy of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
