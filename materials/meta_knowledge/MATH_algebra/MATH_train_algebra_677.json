{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponent Behavior:** Recognize how different bases behave with different exponents. For example, powers of 2 grow faster than powers of 3, which grow faster than powers of 4.\n\n2. **Estimation and Bounds:** Estimate the range of possible values for \\( x \\) by considering the growth rates of the terms. For instance, \\( 4^x \\) grows very quickly, so \\( x \\) is likely to be relatively small.\n\n3. **Trial and Error:** Since \\( x \\) is a positive integer, you can use trial and error starting from the smallest possible integer. This method is efficient given the rapid growth of \\( 4^x \\).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers and exponents, as these are prone to arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Once you find a candidate value for \\( x \\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step ensures that any computational errors are caught.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
