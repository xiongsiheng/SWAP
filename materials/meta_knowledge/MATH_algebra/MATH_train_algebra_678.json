{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Fraction Addition:** When adding fractions, ensure they have a common denominator. For example, to add \\(\\frac{125}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\), and \\(1\\), first convert all terms to have a common denominator (e.g., 16).\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** Simplify fractions before performing arithmetic operations to avoid complex calculations. For instance, \\(\\frac{125}{2}\\) can be simplified by recognizing that \\(125 = 25 \times 5\\).\n\n3. **Multiplication Order:** When multiplying a sum by a number, you can distribute the multiplication over the sum. This is known as the distributive property, which can simplify calculations.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check each arithmetic operation, especially when dealing with fractions, to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Final Simplification:** After performing all operations, simplify the final result to its simplest form, ensuring no common factors remain.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while computing such expressions."}
