{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving problems involving the operation $\\nabla$, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operation:** Clearly understand the definition of the operation $\\nabla$. It involves adding the two numbers and dividing by 1 plus their product.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply the operation $\\nabla$ correctly by following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). This ensures that the numerator and denominator are calculated accurately.\n\n3. **Nested Operations:** When dealing with nested operations like $(1 \nabla 2) \nabla 3$, perform the operation step-by-step. First, calculate $1 \nabla 2$, and then use the result to calculate the next operation with 3.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, especially multiplication and division, to avoid computational errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the final result, consider verifying the steps by recalculating or using a different method to ensure the accuracy of the solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving the operation $\\nabla$."}
