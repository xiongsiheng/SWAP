{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that the given equation is a linear equation in terms of \\( x \\). For it to have exactly one real solution, the equation must be consistent and not have any restrictions that would eliminate solutions.\n\n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** When dealing with fractions in equations, use cross-multiplication to eliminate the fractions. This step is crucial as it simplifies the equation and makes it easier to solve.\n\n3. **Isolating Variables:** After cross-multiplying, isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. This will help in identifying the conditions under which the equation has exactly one solution.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Result:** Examine the resulting equation after isolating \\( x \\). For the equation to have exactly one real solution, the coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant terms must be such that the equation does not degenerate into a form that allows multiple or no solutions.\n\n5. **Checking for Consistency:** Ensure that the equation does not simplify to a form like \\( 0 = 0 \\) (which implies infinitely many solutions) or \\( k = 0 \\) where \\( k \neq 0 \\) (which implies no solution). This step is vital to confirm that the equation indeed has exactly one solution.\n\n6. **Product of Values:** When finding the product of all real values of \\( r \\), ensure that you correctly identify all possible values of \\( r \\) that satisfy the condition of having exactly one real solution. Multiply these values accurately to get the final answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
