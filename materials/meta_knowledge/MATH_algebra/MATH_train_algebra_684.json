{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Definitions:** Ensure you clearly understand the piecewise function's definition. Identify which part of the function applies based on the input value.\n\n2. **Floor Function Properties:** Remember that the floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{29} \\rfloor\\) is the greatest integer less than \\(\\sqrt{29}\\).\n\n3. **Calculating Square Roots:** Accurately calculate the square root of a number. For \\(\\sqrt{29}\\), recognize that \\(5 < \\sqrt{29} < 6\\), so \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{29} \\rfloor = 5\\).\n\n4. **Applying Function Rules:** Once you determine the value of \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{29} \\rfloor\\), apply the appropriate rule from the piecewise function to find \\(f(\\sqrt{29})\\).\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify your calculations step-by-step to ensure that each part of the function is applied correctly and that arithmetic operations are accurate.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
