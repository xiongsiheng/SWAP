{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem involving transformations of parabolas, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Vertex Form:** Recognize that the equation \\( y = (x-2)^2 + 3 \\) is in vertex form \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\), where the vertex is at \\( (h, k) \\). Here, the vertex is \\( (2, 3) \\).\n\n2. **Rotation of Parabola:** Rotating a parabola 180 degrees about its vertex changes the sign of the quadratic term. If the original equation is \\( y = (x-2)^2 + 3 \\), the rotated equation becomes \\( y = -(x-2)^2 + 3 \\).\n\n3. **Horizontal and Vertical Shifts:** Shifting the parabola 3 units to the left involves replacing \\( x \\) with \\( x+3 \\). Shifting 2 units down involves subtracting 2 from the entire equation.\n\n4. **Finding Zeros:** To find the zeros of the transformed parabola, set the equation equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\). This will give you the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n5. **Sum of Zeros:** For a quadratic equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the sum of the zeros (roots) is given by \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\). This property can be used to quickly find \\( a + b \\) once the transformed equation is in standard form.\n\n6. **Verification:** Always verify the transformations step by step to ensure accuracy. Mistakes in understanding or applying transformations can lead to incorrect results.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving transformations of parabolas."}
