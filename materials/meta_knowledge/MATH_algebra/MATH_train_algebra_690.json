{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor r \\rfloor\\) represents the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(r\\). This means \\(\\lfloor r \\rfloor\\) is an integer and \\(r\\) can be expressed as \\(\\lfloor r \\rfloor + f\\), where \\(0 \\leq f < 1\\) is the fractional part of \\(r\\).\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:** Express \\(r\\) in terms of its integer and fractional parts. For example, if \\(\\lfloor r \\rfloor = n\\), then \\(r = n + f\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer and \\(0 \\leq f < 1\\).\n\n3. **Solving for Integer and Fractional Parts:** Substitute \\(r = n + f\\) into the equation and solve for \\(n\\) and \\(f\\). Ensure that \\(f\\) satisfies the condition \\(0 \\leq f < 1\\).\n\n4. **Checking Constraints:** Verify that the values of \\(n\\) and \\(f\\) satisfy the original equation and the constraints on \\(f\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
