{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Recognize that you can set up a system of equations with the given information. For example, if the sum of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is 25, you have \\( x + y = 25 \\), and if their product is 126, you have \\( xy = 126 \\).\n\n2. **Quadratic Equations:** Understand that these equations can be transformed into a quadratic equation. For instance, from \\( x + y = 25 \\), you can express \\( y \\) as \\( 25 - x \\), and substitute into \\( xy = 126 \\) to get a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Solving Quadratics:** Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Ensure you correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Checking Solutions:** After solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), verify that these values satisfy both original equations.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:** Once you have the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), calculate their difference and then find the absolute value. Ensure you perform subtraction correctly and take the absolute value to ensure a non-negative result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
