{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying this type of expression, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rationalizing Denominators:** When dealing with fractions that have a radical in the denominator, it's often helpful to rationalize the denominator. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\n2. **Conjugates:** Remember that the conjugate of \\(1 + \\sqrt{2}\\) is \\(1 - \\sqrt{2}\\) and vice versa. Using conjugates helps eliminate radicals from the denominator.\n\n3. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly when multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate. This means multiplying each term in the numerator by each term in the conjugate of the denominator.\n\n4. **Simplifying Products of Conjugates:** Understand that the product of a conjugate pair (like \\(1 + \\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(1 - \\sqrt{2}\\)) results in a difference of squares, which simplifies to an integer.\n\n5. **Checking Final Simplification:** After simplifying, double-check that no further simplifications are possible and that the expression is in its simplest form.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while simplifying such expressions."}
