{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the domain of a rational function like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Denominator:** The domain of a rational function is restricted by the values that make the denominator zero. Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** Use the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) to find the roots of the quadratic equation \\( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \\). Here, \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = -6 \\), and \\( c = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Check the Discriminant:** Ensure the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) is non-negative to confirm real roots. For \\( 2x^2 - 6x + 4 \\), the discriminant is \\( (-6)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 = 36 - 32 = 4 \\), which is positive, indicating two real roots.\n\n4. **Calculate the Roots:** Substitute \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) into the quadratic formula to find the values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero.\n\n5. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots (using Vieta's formulas) is \\( -\frac{b}{a} \\). This directly gives you \\( A + B \\).\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations for the roots and the sum to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy in determining the domain and calculating \\( A + B \\)."}
