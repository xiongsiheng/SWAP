{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving systems of linear equations like this, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Elimination Method:** When using the elimination method, ensure you multiply the equations correctly so that one of the variables cancels out. This involves careful multiplication and addition/subtraction of the equations.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:** If you choose to use the substitution method, isolate one variable correctly and substitute it into the other equation without making algebraic mistakes.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, as small errors in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Check Your Work:** After finding the values of the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both equations. This step helps catch any errors made during the solving process.\n\n5. **Consistency:** Ensure that the system of equations is consistent and does not have a contradictory solution, which would indicate an error in setting up or solving the equations.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving systems of linear equations."}
