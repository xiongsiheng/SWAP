{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving floor functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Floor Function:** The floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor 17.2 \\rfloor = 17\\) and \\(\\lfloor -17.2 \\rfloor = -18\\).\n\n2. **Handling Negative Numbers:** When dealing with negative numbers, the floor function can be counterintuitive. For instance, \\(\\lfloor -17.2 \\rfloor\\) is not \\(-17\\) but rather \\(-18\\), because \\(-18\\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(-17.2\\).\n\n3. **Addition of Floors:** When adding the results of floor functions, ensure you are adding the integers directly. For example, \\(\\lfloor 17.2 \\rfloor + \\(\\lfloor -17.2 \\rfloor\\) = 17 + (-18) = -1\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with negative numbers, to avoid common pitfalls in understanding the floor function.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating expressions involving floor functions."}
