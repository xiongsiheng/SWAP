{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand that \\( f(g(x)) \\) means you first apply the function \\( g \\) to \\( x \\), and then apply the function \\( f \\) to the result of \\( g(x) \\). This is known as function composition.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Ensure you follow the correct order of operations when evaluating \\( f(g(x)) \\). First, compute \\( g(x) \\), and then use this result as the input for \\( f \\).\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** When substituting values into functions, make sure you substitute correctly. Double-check that you are using the correct function and the correct value.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with integers. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your result by independently computing \\( g(8) \\) and then \\( f(g(8)) \\) to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
