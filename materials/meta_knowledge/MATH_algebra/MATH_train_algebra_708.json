{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Inequalities:** Recognize that inequalities involving square roots require careful handling. For example, if \\(\\sqrt{a} > b\\), then \\(a > b^2\\).\n\n2. **Squaring Both Sides:** When you square both sides of an inequality, ensure that the direction of the inequality remains correct. If both sides are positive, the direction stays the same.\n\n3. **Range of Values:** Identify the range of values for \\(x\\) by converting the inequality \\(\\sqrt{2x} > 3\\) to \\(2x > 9\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2x} < 4\\) to \\(2x < 16\\).\n\n4. **Solving for x:** From the inequalities, solve for \\(x\\) to get \\(x > 4.5\\) and \\(x < 8\\). This means \\(x\\) must be between 4.5 and 8.\n\n5. **Integer Solutions:** Determine the integer values within this range. In this case, the integers are 5, 6, and 7.\n\n6. **Counting Solutions:** Count the number of integer solutions within the specified range. Here, there are 3 integer values that satisfy the condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
