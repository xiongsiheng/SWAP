{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope Calculation:** Ensure you correctly calculate the slope of the line using the formula \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). Be careful with the order of subtraction to avoid sign errors.\n\n2. **Equation of a Line:** Use the point-slope form of the line equation, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), substituting one of the given points and the calculated slope. This helps in forming the correct linear equation.\n\n3. **Intersection with the x-axis:** Recall that any point on the x-axis has a y-coordinate of 0. Set \\(y = 0\\) in the line equation and solve for \\(x\\) to find the x-intercept.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions or decimals, as these can lead to calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by checking if the calculated x-intercept, when substituted back into the line equation, results in \\(y = 0\\). This step can help catch any algebraic or arithmetic mistakes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
