{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of inequality, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Separate the Inequalities:** Break the compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one independently. Then, find the intersection of the solution sets.\n\n2. **Clear Fractions:** If there are fractions in the inequality, consider multiplying through by a common denominator to clear the fractions. This can simplify the process but be careful with signs, especially if multiplying by a negative number, as it will reverse the inequality direction.\n\n3. **Check for Extraneous Solutions:** When dealing with inequalities, especially those involving fractions or absolute values, solutions from one part of the inequality might not satisfy the entire compound inequality. Always verify that your solutions satisfy all parts of the original compound inequality.\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** When expressing your answer in interval notation, ensure that you correctly represent the boundaries (open or closed) based on whether the endpoints satisfy the inequality.\n\n5. **Simplify Expressions:** Simplify expressions on both sides of the inequality as much as possible before solving. This includes combining like terms and simplifying fractions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such inequalities."}
