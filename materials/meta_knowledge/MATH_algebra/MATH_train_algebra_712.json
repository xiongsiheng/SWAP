{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to calculate the distance between two points: \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). Ensure you correctly substitute the coordinates of the points into the formula.\n\n2. **Equidistant Points:** Since the point is on the y-axis, its x-coordinate is 0. Set up the equation such that the distances from this point to points A and B are equal.\n\n3. **Simplifying Equations:** When you set up the equation using the distance formula, simplify it step by step. Ensure that each step is mathematically correct and that you are solving for the correct variable (in this case, y).\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your calculations, especially when squaring numbers and when simplifying square roots. Small errors in these steps can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n5. **Substitution Verification:** Once you find the y-coordinate, substitute it back into the distance formula to verify that the distances from this point to points A and B are indeed equal.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
