{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Linear Relationships:** Understand that a linear decrease means the number of cases decreases at a constant rate over time. This can be represented by a straight line on a graph where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents the number of cases.\n\n2. **Calculating the Rate of Decrease:** Determine the rate of decrease per year by dividing the total decrease in cases by the total number of years between the two data points.\n\n3. **Interpolation:** Use the calculated rate of decrease to estimate the number of cases at any point between the given years. This involves finding the y-value (number of cases) at a specific x-value (year) on the linear graph.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers and small fractions, to avoid rounding errors that can significantly affect the final answer.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the calculations and the method used to ensure that the assumption of linearity is correctly applied and that the answer is reasonable given the context of the problem.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
