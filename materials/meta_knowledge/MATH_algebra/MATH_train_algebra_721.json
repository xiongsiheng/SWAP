{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions involving floor and ceiling functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Floor Function:** The floor function, denoted by \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lfloor 0.999 \\rfloor = 0\\).\n\n2. **Understanding Ceiling Function:** The ceiling function, denoted by \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\), returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). For example, \\(\\lceil 2.001 \\rceil = 3\\).\n\n3. **Exact Values:** Ensure you are using the exact values provided in the problem. For instance, \\(0.999\\) and \\(2.001\\) are specific values that should not be approximated or rounded off prematurely.\n\n4. **Combining Results:** After determining the values of the floor and ceiling functions, add them together as instructed. This step should be straightforward if the previous steps are done correctly.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always double-check your calculations to ensure that you have applied the floor and ceiling functions correctly and that the final addition is accurate.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving floor and ceiling functions."}
