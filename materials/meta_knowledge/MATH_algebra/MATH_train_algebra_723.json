{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rewriting Equations:** Look for ways to rewrite the equation in a more manageable form. For example, you might try factoring or completing the square.\n\n2. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers, consider using integer properties and techniques like the integer constraint method or the use of divisibility rules.\n\n3. **Testing Values:** Sometimes, testing specific integer values for \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) can help identify patterns or solutions quickly.\n\n4. **Maximizing Values:** When asked to find the greatest possible value of a variable, consider how changes in one variable affect the other. Often, setting one variable to an extreme value (like its maximum or minimum possible integer) can simplify the problem.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding a potential solution, verify it by substituting the values back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
