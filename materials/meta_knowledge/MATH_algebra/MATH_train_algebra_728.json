{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when rewriting a quadratic equation in the form of \\((ax + b)^2 + c\\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Perfect Square Trinomial:** Recognize that \\((ax + b)^2\\) expands to \\(a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2\\). This form should match the quadratic term, linear term, and constant term of the original quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Coefficient Matching:** Ensure that the coefficients of \\(x^2\\), \\(x\\), and the constant term from the original quadratic match those derived from \\((ax + b)^2\\). This will help determine \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(c\\):** After determining \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), calculate \\(c\\) by comparing the constant terms of the original quadratic and the expression \\((ax + b)^2 + c\\).\n\n4. **Integer Constraints:** Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are integers, ensure that your calculations respect this constraint, especially when solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) by expanding \\((ax + b)^2 + c\\) and confirming it matches the original quadratic.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors in transforming the quadratic equation."}
