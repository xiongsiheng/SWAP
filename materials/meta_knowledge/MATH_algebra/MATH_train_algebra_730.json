{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Recall that the midpoint \\( C \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( A = (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B = (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by \\( C = \\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \\).\n\n2. **Equating Coordinates:** Since \\( C \\) is the midpoint, equate the coordinates of \\( C \\) to the midpoint formula applied to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). This will give you two equations (one for the x-coordinates and one for the y-coordinates).\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** Solve the two equations simultaneously to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Ensure that you correctly isolate variables and perform algebraic manipulations accurately.\n\n4. **Calculating the Product:** Once you have the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), calculate the product \\( xy \\) carefully to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by checking if \\( (3, 5) \\) is indeed the midpoint of \\( (1, 8) \\) and \\( (x, y) \\) using the midpoint formula.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
