{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the inverse of a composite function, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Composite Functions:** First, understand how to compute the composite function \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) \\). This involves substituting \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Finding the Inverse:** To find the inverse of \\( h(x) \\), start by expressing \\( h(x) \\) in terms of \\( x \\). Then, switch the roles of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) (where \\( y = h(x) \\)) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be meticulous with algebraic manipulations, especially when solving for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\). Ensure that each step is logically sound and that you do not make errors in distribution or simplification.\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding the inverse, verify it by checking that \\( h(h^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( h^{-1}(h(x)) = x \\). This step confirms that the inverse function is correctly derived.\n\n5. **Domain and Range:** Consider the domain and range of both \\( h(x) \\) and \\( h^{-1}(x) \\). Ensure that the inverse function is defined for all values in the range of \\( h(x) \\).\n\nThese points will help minimize errors when solving for the inverse of a composite function."}
