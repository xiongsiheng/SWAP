{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Rates and Times:** Ensure you correctly interpret the relationship between the rates and times of different individuals. In this case, understand that Jordan's time is half of Steve's time for a different distance.\n\n2. **Calculating Speed:** Calculate the speed of each person correctly using the formula \\( \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \\). This will help in determining the time for different distances.\n\n3. **Proportionality:** Recognize that if the speed remains constant, the time taken to travel a certain distance is directly proportional to the distance. Use this proportionality to find the time for new distances.\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to the calculations, especially when dividing or multiplying numbers, to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure all units are consistent throughout the problem. For example, if time is given in minutes, ensure all calculations involving time are also in minutes.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
