{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating functions, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value correctly into the function. For example, if you need to find \\( f(-1) \\) for \\( f(x) = x^2 - 1 \\), replace every \\( x \\) in the function with \\(-1\\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression. This means squaring the input value first, then subtracting 1.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers, as these can often lead to common mistakes.\n\n4. **Verification:** After calculating the value, it can be helpful to quickly verify the result by mentally checking if the steps make sense and if the result is plausible given the function's behavior.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating functions."}
