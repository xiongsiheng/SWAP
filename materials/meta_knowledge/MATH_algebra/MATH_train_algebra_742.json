{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the value of \\( t \\) for a point on a straight line given by a table of points, consider the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Slope:** Calculate the slope of the line using any two points from the table. The slope \\( m \\) is given by \\( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\).\n\n2. **Form the Equation:** Use the slope and one of the points to form the equation of the line in the form \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n\n3. **Substitute Values:** Substitute the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the new point (28 in this case) into the equation of the line to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinate \\( t \\).\n\n4. **Check Consistency:** Ensure that the calculated slope is consistent across different pairs of points to verify the correctness of the line equation.\n\n5. **Avoid Rounding Errors:** When calculating, avoid rounding intermediate results unless absolutely necessary, as rounding can introduce small errors that affect the final answer.\n\nBy following these steps, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the value of \\( t \\) for the point on the line."}
