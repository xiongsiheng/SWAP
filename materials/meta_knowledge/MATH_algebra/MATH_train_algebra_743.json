{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Expanding Both Sides:** When you expand both sides of an equation, ensure that you distribute correctly. For example, \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n2. **Equating Like Terms:** After expanding, equate the like terms on both sides of the equation. This helps in isolating the variable.\n\n3. **Solving Quadratic Equations:** Recognize that you might end up with a quadratic equation. Use methods like factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula to solve for the variable.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** After solving, check if both solutions satisfy the original equation. Sometimes, one of the solutions might not fit the context of the original problem.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to avoid common calculation errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
