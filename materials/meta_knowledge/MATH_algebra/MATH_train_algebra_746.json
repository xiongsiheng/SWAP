{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating a function at a specific value, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value correctly into the function. For example, if the function is \\( f(x) = 3x + 1 \\) and you need to find \\( f(3) \\), replace every \\( x \\) in the function with 3.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Precision:** Perform arithmetic operations carefully to avoid simple calculation errors. In the example, \\( f(3) = 3(3) + 1 \\), which simplifies to \\( 9 + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Final Check:** Optionally, double-check your final result by performing the calculation again or using a calculator to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese steps will help ensure that you correctly evaluate the function at the given point."}
