{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Absolute Value:** Understand that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. For example, \\(|a|\\) equals \\(a\\) if \\(a\\) is positive or zero, and \\(-a\\) if \\(a\\) is negative.\n\n2. **Simplifying Expressions:** Simplify the expression inside the absolute value first. For instance, in \\(|{-17 + 3}|\\), calculate \\(-17 + 3\\) to get \\(-14\\), then take the absolute value to get \\(14\\).\n\n3. **Solving Linear Equations:** Once the absolute value is simplified, solve the resulting linear equation. In this case, you would solve \\(2x + 4 = 14\\) by isolating \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Check Your Work:** After finding the value of \\(x\\), substitute it back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation. This step ensures that there are no calculation errors.\n\n5. **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to signs and operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and absolute values, as these are common sources of error.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
