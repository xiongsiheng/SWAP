{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Recall the midpoint formula, which states that the coordinates of the midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) are given by \\( M\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the midpoint formula to set up equations for the coordinates of point \\( B \\). For example, if \\( M(3, 7) \\) is the midpoint and \\( A(9, 3) \\) is one endpoint, then \\( 3 = \frac{9 + x_2}{2} \\) and \\( 7 = \frac{3 + y_2}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Coordinates:** Solve the equations for \\( x_2 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) individually. This involves isolating \\( x_2 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) and performing the necessary arithmetic operations.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic when solving for \\( x_2 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Summing Coordinates:** Once you have the coordinates of point \\( B \\), add them together to find the sum. Ensure that you add both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate correctly.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
