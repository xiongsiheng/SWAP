{"Knowledge": "To find the minimum value of a quadratic function of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form:** The minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex. For \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Once you find the x-coordinate of the vertex, substitute it back into the original quadratic function to find the corresponding y-value, which represents the minimum or maximum value.\n\n3. **Coefficient Signs:** If the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) (a) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the vertex represents the minimum value. If a is negative, the parabola opens downwards, and the vertex represents the maximum value.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Ensure that calculations involving fractions and square roots are performed accurately to avoid numerical errors.\n\n5. **Graphical Check:** Optionally, you can sketch the quadratic function to visually confirm the location of the vertex and the direction of the parabola.\n\nThese guidelines will help you accurately determine the minimum value of the given quadratic function."}
