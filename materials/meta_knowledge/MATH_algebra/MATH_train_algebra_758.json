{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the System of Equations:** Recognize that you are dealing with a system of two equations with two variables. This often involves substitution or elimination methods.\n\n2. **Identifying Symmetric Expressions:** Notice that the expression \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) can be factored as \\(xy(x + y)\\). This factorization can simplify the computation if you can express \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\) in terms of simpler forms derived from the given equations.\n\n3. **Using Substitution Wisely:** When substituting variables, ensure that the substitutions are valid and do not introduce extraneous solutions. For example, solving for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) from one equation and substituting into the other can be effective.\n\n4. **Checking for Consistency:** After solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), substitute these values back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and complex expressions. Errors in basic arithmetic can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n6. **Final Substitution:** Once you have determined \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), carefully substitute these values into \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) to compute the final answer, ensuring all steps are correct and the result is consistent with the problem constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
