{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** The sum of the first \\( n \\) counting numbers (an arithmetic series) can be calculated using the formula \\( S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). For this problem, \\( n = 102 \\).\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic:** When finding the remainder of a number divided by another number, use modular arithmetic. Specifically, calculate \\( S_{102} \\mod 5250 \\).\n\n3. **Avoiding Large Number Calculations:** To simplify calculations, break down the sum into manageable parts. For example, calculate \\( \frac{102 \times 103}{2} \\mod 5250 \\) directly, or use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the process.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all steps, especially multiplication and division, are performed accurately to avoid computational errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the remainder, consider verifying the result by checking the steps or using a different method if possible.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
