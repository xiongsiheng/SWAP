{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to compose functions. For \\( f(g(x)) \\), first evaluate \\( g(x) \\) and then use the result as the input for \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating expressions, especially within functions.\n\n3. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure accurate substitution when replacing variables with given values or expressions. Double-check that you have substituted correctly.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers or complex expressions, to avoid common mistakes.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your final answer by independently re-evaluating the function composition to ensure consistency.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
