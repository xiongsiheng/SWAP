{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating a function at a specific value, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value correctly into the function. Double-check that you have replaced every instance of \\( x \\) with the specified value, in this case, \\(-2\\).\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating the function. This includes handling parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers. Errors often occur in multiplication and subtraction involving negative values.\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Simplify the expression step by step, ensuring that each step is correct before proceeding to the next. This helps in identifying and correcting any mistakes early.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After obtaining the result, you can quickly re-evaluate the function mentally or on paper to verify that your calculation is correct.\n\nThese steps will help minimize errors and ensure accurate evaluation of the function at the given point."}
