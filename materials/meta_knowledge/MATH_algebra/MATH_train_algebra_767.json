{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Compound Interest:** Compound interest is calculated based on the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is \\(A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after \\(n\\) times per year for \\(t\\) years, \\(P\\) is the principal amount, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate, and \\(n\\) is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.\n\n2. **Equivalence of Interest Rates:** To find the equivalent annual interest rate \\(r\\) for a monthly compounding rate, set the compound interest formula for both scenarios equal to each other and solve for \\(r\\).\n\n3. **Mathematical Precision:** When dealing with exponents and roots, use precise calculations to avoid rounding errors. Keep intermediate values in their exact form until the final step.\n\n4. **Rounding Correctly:** When giving the final answer to the nearest hundredth, ensure that you round appropriately. Use the standard rounding rules (if the next digit is 5 or more, round up; if it is less than 5, round down).\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating \\(r\\), you can verify your answer by substituting it back into the compound interest formula to ensure it matches the original conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
