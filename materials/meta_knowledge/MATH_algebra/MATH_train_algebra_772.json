{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly identify the constraints and variables. In this case, the fencing covers three sides of a rectangle, and you need to maximize the area.\n\n2. **Formulating the Equation:** Express the area of the rectangle in terms of one variable. If \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width, then the area \\( A \\) is \\( A = l \times w \\). Since the fencing covers three sides, you have \\( 2w + l = 360 \\).\n\n3. **Maximizing the Area:** Use calculus or algebraic methods to find the maximum value of the area function. For rectangles, the maximum area under such constraints typically occurs when the shape is a square (or as close to a square as possible).\n\n4. **Checking Constraints:** Ensure that the solution satisfies the original constraints (in this case, the total length of fencing used).\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify all arithmetic and algebraic steps to avoid simple mistakes that can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
