{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation:** Start by rearranging the equation into standard quadratic form, \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), if it is not already in that form.\n\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring is not straightforward, use the quadratic formula \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) to find the roots of the equation.\n\n3. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots can be directly found using the relationship \\(-b/a\\), which is derived from the quadratic formula.\n\n4. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and divisions, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Substitution Check:** Although not necessary for finding the sum of the roots, substituting the roots back into the original equation can confirm their correctness.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
