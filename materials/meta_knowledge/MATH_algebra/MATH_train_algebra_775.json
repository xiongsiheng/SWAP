{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Composition:** When dealing with composite functions like \\(f(f(x))\\), first determine the domain of the inner function \\(f(x)\\). For \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x-3}\\), the domain is \\(x \\geq 3\\) because the expression under the square root must be non-negative.\n\n2. **Nested Domains:** For \\(f(f(x))\\), ensure that \\(f(x)\\) itself produces a valid input for \\(f\\). This means \\(f(x) \\geq 3\\), which translates to \\(\\sqrt{x-3} \\geq 3\\). Solving this inequality involves squaring both sides to remove the square root, leading to \\(x-3 \\geq 9\\) or \\(x \\geq 12\\).\n\n3. **Inequality Manipulation:** Be careful when solving inequalities, especially after squaring both sides. Ensure that the direction of the inequality remains correct.\n\n4. **Verification:** After finding the smallest value of \\(x\\), verify that it satisfies the original condition \\(f(f(x))\\) is defined. This step helps confirm that no errors were made in the domain analysis.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
