{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula for finding the roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\): \\(x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). This formula is essential for finding the values of \\(d\\) and \\(e\\).\n\n2. **Sum and Product of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots \\(d + e\\) is given by \\(-\frac{b}{a}\\) and the product of the roots \\(de\\) is given by \\(\frac{c}{a}\\). These relationships can simplify calculations.\n\n3. **Simplifying Expressions:** When calculating \\((d-1)(e-1)\\), expand the expression to \\((d-1)(e-1) = de - (d+e) + 1\\). Use the sum and product of roots to substitute values directly.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Ensure that arithmetic operations are performed accurately, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots. Small errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect final answers.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating the value of \\((d-1)(e-1)\\), it can be useful to verify the result by substituting the roots \\(d\\) and \\(e\\) back into the expression to confirm it matches the calculated value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
