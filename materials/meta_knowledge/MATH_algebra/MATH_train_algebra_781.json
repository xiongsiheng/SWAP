{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the common ratio of an infinite geometric series, consider the following:\n\n1. **Definition of Common Ratio:** The common ratio (r) in a geometric series is found by dividing any term by the preceding term. Ensure you correctly identify the terms of the series.\n\n2. **Consistency in Calculation:** When calculating the common ratio, use the same method for each pair of terms to maintain consistency. For example, always divide the second term by the first, the third by the second, and so on.\n\n3. **Accuracy in Division:** Pay close attention to the division of fractions, ensuring you correctly apply the rule of dividing by a fraction (multiply by its reciprocal).\n\n4. **Verification of Ratio:** After calculating the common ratio, verify that it remains consistent across different pairs of terms in the series. This step helps confirm the correctness of your calculation.\n\n5. **Sign Considerations:** Be mindful of the signs of the terms, especially when the series involves negative numbers. The common ratio should correctly reflect the alternating signs if applicable.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and reduce errors in determining the common ratio of a geometric series."}
