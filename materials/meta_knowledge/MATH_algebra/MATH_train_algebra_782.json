{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponents:** Understand the properties of exponents, such as \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\). This will help in simplifying expressions.\n\n2. **Fractional Operations:** Be precise when dealing with fractions, especially when multiplying or dividing by fractions. For example, \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2^{30} = 2^{30} \\cdot 2^{-2} = 2^{28}\\).\n\n3. **Equating Exponents:** When you have an equation like \\(2^{28} = 4^x\\), remember that \\(4 = 2^2\\), so \\(4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}\\). This allows you to equate the exponents directly.\n\n4. **Solving for Unknowns:** When equating exponents, set the exponents equal to each other and solve for the unknown. In this case, \\(28 = 2x\\), so \\(x = 14\\).\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your solution by substituting the value of \\(x\\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds True. This step will catch any errors in your calculations or reasoning.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
