{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Exponential Growth:** Understand that the growth of each species of ants follows an exponential pattern. For Species A, the number of ants doubles each day, which can be represented as \\( A_n = A_0 \\cdot 2^n \\), where \\( A_n \\) is the number of ants on day \\( n \\), and \\( A_0 \\) is the initial number of ants of Species A.\n\n2. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations to represent the total number of ants over the days. This involves expressing the number of ants of each species on Day 5 in terms of their initial counts and growth rates.\n\n3. **Initial Conditions:** Use the information given about the total number of ants on Day 0 and Day 5 to form equations that can be solved for the initial number of ants of each species.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** Be meticulous with your calculations, especially when dealing with exponents and solving for unknowns. Small arithmetic errors can significantly impact the final result.\n\n5. **Verification:** After solving for the number of ants of Species A, verify your solution by substituting the values back into the equations to ensure they satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
