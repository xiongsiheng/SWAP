{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Quadratic Functions:** Recognize that the given equation \\( y = -x^2 + 5 \\) is a quadratic function in the form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a = -1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), and \\( c = 5 \\). Since \\( a \\) is negative, the parabola opens downward, indicating that the function has a maximum value.\n\n2. **Vertex of a Parabola:** The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex. For a quadratic function \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \\). Substitute this value back into the function to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n3. **Calculating the Vertex:** In this case, since \\( b = 0 \\), the x-coordinate of the vertex is \\( x = -\frac{0}{2(-1)} = 0 \\). Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the function \\( y = -x^2 + 5 \\) to find the maximum value of \\( y \\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that you correctly substitute and calculate the vertex value to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify by graphing the function or considering the nature of the parabola to confirm that the calculated maximum value is indeed the highest possible value for \\( y \\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
