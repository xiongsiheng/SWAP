{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating polynomial expressions, consider the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given value of \\( x \\) correctly into each term of the polynomial.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when performing calculations. This means performing multiplications before additions.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to detail when performing arithmetic operations, especially multiplications and additions, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n4. **Checking Work:** After calculating the value, it can be helpful to quickly check your work by estimating the result or performing the operations in a different order to ensure consistency.\n\n5. **Use of Calculator:** If using a calculator, ensure that you input the values and operations correctly to avoid keystroke errors.\n\nThese practices will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors when evaluating polynomial expressions."}
