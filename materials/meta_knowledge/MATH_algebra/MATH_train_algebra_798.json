{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Range:** Since $p$ is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, there are exactly 10 possible values for $p$.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Equation:** The equation $pq - 4p - 2q = 2$ is a linear Diophantine equation. To find solutions, you might need to rearrange it into a form that allows you to solve for $q$ in terms of $p$, or vice versa.\n\n3. **Checking for Integer Solutions:** Once you have a general form for $q$ in terms of $p$, ensure that $q$ is an integer for each possible value of $p$. This involves checking divisibility conditions or solving for $q$ explicitly.\n\n4. **Calculating Probability:** The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (values of $p$ that allow an integer $q$) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (10 in this case). Ensure you count correctly and simplify fractions accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the logic of your solution to ensure that you have not missed any steps or made arithmetic errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
