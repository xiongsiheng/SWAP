{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Perimeter and Area:** Recall the formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter \\( P \\) is given by \\( P = 2l + 2w \\) where \\( l \\) is the length and \\( w \\) is the width. The area \\( A \\) is given by \\( A = lw \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Use the given perimeter and area to set up two equations with the variables \\( l \\) and \\( w \\). This will allow you to solve for the dimensions of the rectangle.\n\n3. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When solving the system of equations, ensure you handle the algebraic manipulations correctly. This includes correctly factoring or using the quadratic formula if necessary.\n\n4. **Checking Dimensions:** Once you find the dimensions, verify that they satisfy both the perimeter and area conditions to ensure your solution is correct.\n\n5. **Identifying the Shorter Side:** After determining both dimensions, simply compare them to identify which is the shorter side.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
