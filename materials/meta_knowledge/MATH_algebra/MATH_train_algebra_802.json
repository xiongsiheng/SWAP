{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when computing sums involving complex numbers and powers of \\(i\\), keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Cycles of \\(i\\):** Remember that powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four terms: \\(i^1 = i\\), \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), \\(i^4 = 1\\), and then the cycle repeats. This pattern can be used to simplify higher powers of \\(i\\).\n\n2. **Sum of a Geometric Series:** Recognize when you are dealing with a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series \\(a + ar + ar^2 + \\cdots + ar^{n-1}\\) is given by \\(S = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term, \\(r\\) is the common ratio, and \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n\n3. **Simplifying Complex Sums:** When adding complex numbers, group real parts and imaginary parts separately. For this problem, since \\(i^n\\) for large \\(n\\) will cycle through \\(1, i, -1, -i\\), you can sum these values separately.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be precise with your arithmetic, especially when dealing with negative signs and complex numbers, as these can lead to common errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After computing the sum, verify your result by checking if it makes sense in the context of the problem, especially considering the cyclical nature of \\(i\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
