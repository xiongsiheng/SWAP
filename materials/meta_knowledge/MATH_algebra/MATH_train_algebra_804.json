{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of equations based on the given information. For example, if the integers are \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), you have \\(x^2 + y^2 = 193\\) and \\(xy = 84\\).\n\n2. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Utilize algebraic identities such as \\((x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\\) to simplify the problem. This can help you find the sum of the integers more efficiently.\n\n3. **Checking Integer Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers, as specified in the problem. This involves verifying that the values satisfy both original equations.\n\n4. **Avoiding Common Mistakes:** Be cautious of common mistakes such as misapplying algebraic identities or incorrectly substituting values into equations. Double-check each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify your final answer by substituting the values back into the original equations to confirm they satisfy both conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
