{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up a system of linear equations based on the given conditions. For example, if the sum of two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is 19, you can write \\( x + y = 19 \\). Similarly, for their difference, write \\( x - y = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Solving by Elimination or Substitution:** Use either the elimination method or the substitution method to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). In the elimination method, add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable. In the substitution method, solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other equation.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** After finding the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), double-check your arithmetic calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Calculating the Product:** Once you have the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), multiply them to find their product. Ensure that you perform this multiplication correctly.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, verify your solution by checking if the sum and difference of the numbers match the given conditions.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
