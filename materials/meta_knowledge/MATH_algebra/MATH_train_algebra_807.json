{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:** The sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers is given by the formula \\( S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). This formula helps in calculating the correct sum if no page number is added twice.\n\n2. **Identifying the Error:** Since one page number was added twice, the incorrect sum is \\( S + x = 1986 \\), where \\( x \\) is the page number added twice. You need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( S + x = 1986 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\( n \\):** Estimate \\( n \\) by solving \\( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \u0007pprox 1986 \\) to get an approximate value of \\( n \\). This helps in narrowing down the range of possible values for \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Checking Possible Values:** Once you have an approximate \\( n \\), calculate the correct sum \\( S \\) and then systematically check values around \\( S \\) to find which number, when added to \\( S \\), equals 1986.\n\n5. **Verification:** Always verify by substituting the found \\( x \\) back into the equation \\( S + x = 1986 \\) to ensure it satisfies the condition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
