{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** Understand how to correctly compose functions. For \\( f(g(x)) \\), substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\), and for \\( g(f(x)) \\), substitute \\( f(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Simplifying Rational Expressions:** When dealing with rational functions, ensure that you simplify the expressions correctly. This includes factoring, canceling common terms, and combining like terms.\n\n3. **Substitution:** When evaluating functions at specific values (like \\( x = 1 \\)), substitute the value directly into the function and simplify step by step.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and polynomials, as these can be prone to calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the final expression, substitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the expression to verify that the result matches the expected value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
