{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Complex Numbers Addition:** Remember that when adding or subtracting complex numbers, you add or subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, if you have \\((a + bi) + (c + di)\\), the result is \\((a + c) + (b + d)i\\).\n\n2. **Identifying the Difference:** To find what number must be added to one complex number to get another, subtract the first complex number from the second. This involves subtracting the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n\n3. **Handling Imaginary Unit:** Keep in mind that \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit where \\(i^2 = -1\\). This property is crucial when simplifying expressions involving \\(i\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative signs and imaginary parts, as these can lead to common errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the number to add, verify by adding it to the original complex number and ensuring the result matches the target complex number. This step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
