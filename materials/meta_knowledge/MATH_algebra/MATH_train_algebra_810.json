{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Understand that a system of linear equations can be solved using methods such as substitution or elimination. Ensure you apply these methods correctly.\n\n2. **Consistency and Solvability:** Check if the system is consistent and has a solution. If the system is inconsistent (i.e., the lines described by the equations are parallel but not the same), there will be no solution.\n\n3. **Manipulating Equations:** When manipulating equations, especially when multiplying or dividing, ensure that you do not inadvertently change the solution set of the system.\n\n4. **Fraction Simplification:** When finding the ratio \\(\frac{a}{b}\\), simplify fractions carefully to avoid common errors in arithmetic.\n\n5. **Assumption Check:** Since \\(b \neq 0\\) is given, ensure that your solution respects this condition. If \\(b\\) were to become zero in your solution, it would indicate a potential error in the solution process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
