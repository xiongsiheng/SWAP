{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Arithmetic Sequences:** An arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms. This difference is called the common difference.\n\n2. **Finding the Common Difference:** Calculate the common difference by subtracting the first term from the second term (e.g., \\(7 - 2\\)).\n\n3. **Using the Common Difference:** Once you have the common difference, you can find any term in the sequence by adding the common difference to the previous term.\n\n4. **Calculating Intermediate Terms:** Use the common difference to find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) by adding the common difference to the known terms.\n\n5. **Summing Terms:** After finding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), add them together to get \\(a + b\\).\n\n6. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations are correct, especially when adding or subtracting the common difference multiple times.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
