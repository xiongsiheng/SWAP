{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:** Recognize that the dog is constrained to move within a circle centered at the point $(4, 3)$ with a radius of 10 feet. The greatest distance from the origin will be along a line that passes through the center of this circle.\n\n2. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** Calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle using the Pythagorean theorem, which is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2}$. This gives the straight-line distance from the origin to the center of the circle.\n\n3. **Adding the Radius:** The greatest distance from the origin will be this calculated distance plus the radius of the circle (10 feet), as this represents the farthest point on the circumference of the circle from the origin.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Ensure that all calculations, especially those involving square roots and addition, are performed accurately to avoid numerical errors.\n\n5. **Visualization:** Visualizing the problem on a Cartesian plane can help in understanding the geometric constraints and the path the dog can take, which aids in correct calculation of distances.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
