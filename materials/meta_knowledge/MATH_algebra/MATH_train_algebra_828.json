{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when simplifying and multiplying radicals, consider the following:\n\n1. **Product Rule for Radicals:** Remember that the product rule for radicals states that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot b}\\). This rule allows you to combine radicals under a single square root sign.\n\n2. **Simplifying Radicals:** When simplifying radicals, factor out any perfect squares from the radicand. For example, \\(\\sqrt{30p} = \\sqrt{5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot p} = \\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{p}\\).\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After combining radicals using the product rule, check if any terms can be combined further. For instance, \\(\\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 5\\).\n\n4. **Double-Check Multiplications:** Ensure that you multiply the coefficients and the radicands correctly. Missteps in multiplication can lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Final Simplification:** After performing all operations, simplify the expression to its simplest radical form. This often involves reducing the radicand to the smallest possible value.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can minimize errors and ensure the accuracy of your final answer."}
