{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern:** Identify the pattern of growth in the dimensions of the rectangle. In this case, each stage adds a 3'' by 3'' square, which affects the length of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Calculating Dimensions:** Accurately calculate the dimensions of the rectangle at each stage. For example, at Stage 1, the rectangle is 3'' by 3''; at Stage 2, it becomes 6'' by 3'', and so on.\n\n3. **Area Calculation:** Remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Ensure you are using the correct dimensions for the length and width at each stage.\n\n4. **Sequential Addition:** Since each stage adds a fixed-size square, the length increases by 3'' each time, while the width remains constant at 3''.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations, especially when determining the length at each stage, to avoid cumulative errors in the final area calculation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
