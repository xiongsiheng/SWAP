{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly define the terms and conditions given in the problem. For instance, in this case, a rectangle is 'cool' if its area (in square units) equals twice its perimeter (in units), and both side lengths are integers.\n\n2. **Formulating Equations:** Translate the conditions into mathematical equations. For a rectangle with sides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the area is \\(ab\\) and the perimeter is \\(2(a + b)\\). The condition given translates to \\(ab = 2 \times 2(a + b)\\).\n\n3. **Integer Solutions:** Since the side lengths must be integers, consider all possible integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy the equation. This might involve checking small integer values systematically.\n\n4. **Avoiding Duplicates:** When finding solutions, ensure that you do not count the same area more than once. For example, if \\(a = b\\), the rectangle is a square, and its area should be considered only once.\n\n5. **Summing Areas:** After identifying all distinct areas, sum them up correctly. Double-check the addition to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, verify each solution by substituting the side lengths back into the original conditions to confirm they satisfy the 'cool' rectangle criteria.\n\nThese steps should help minimize mistakes while solving problems involving geometric conditions and integer constraints."}
