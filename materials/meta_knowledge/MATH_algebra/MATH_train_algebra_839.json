{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the values of \\( j \\) for which the given quadratic equation has exactly one real solution, consider the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall that a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) has exactly one real solution if and only if its discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) is zero. This is a key principle to apply when solving this type of problem.\n\n2. **Expand and Simplify:** Start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation and then combine like terms with the right-hand side to form a standard quadratic equation in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify Coefficients:** Carefully identify the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) in the resulting quadratic equation. Ensure that you correctly account for any terms involving \\( j \\).\n\n4. **Set Discriminant to Zero:** Set the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) equal to zero and solve for \\( j \\). This will give you the values of \\( j \\) that result in exactly one real solution.\n\n5. **Check Calculations:** Double-check all algebraic manipulations and calculations, especially when dealing with the coefficients and the discriminant, as errors in these steps can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n6. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solutions by substituting the values of \\( j \\) back into the original equation and confirming that it indeed has exactly one real solution.\n\nThese steps will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in solving this type of problem."}
