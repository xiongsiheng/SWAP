{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Percentage Solutions:** A percentage solution refers to the concentration of a substance in a solution. For example, a 30% solution means 30% of the solution is the substance (acid in this case), and the rest is the solvent (water).\n\n2. **Maintaining Concentration Balance:** When adding pure water to dilute a solution, the amount of acid remains constant, but the total volume of the solution increases. The goal is to adjust the volume so that the concentration of acid decreases to the desired percentage.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Use the formula for concentration: \\(\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Amount of Acid}}{\text{Total Volume of Solution}}\\). Set up an equation where the initial amount of acid equals the final amount of acid in the new solution.\n\n4. **Solving for the Unknown:** In this case, the unknown is the amount of water to be added. Solve the equation to find this value, ensuring that the units (ounces) are consistent throughout the calculation.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Calculations:** After solving, verify the calculations by substituting the values back into the concentration formula to ensure the final solution matches the required percentage of acid.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
