{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Recognize that \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\) represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 5. This helps in visualizing the possible integer solutions.\n\n2. **Integer Solutions:** Identify all possible integer pairs \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy the equation. These pairs are typically found by checking combinations of integers whose squares sum to 25.\n\n3. **Maximizing the Sum:** To find the greatest possible sum \\(x + y\\), consider the pairs that are farthest from the origin (i.e., those on the circle's intersection with the axes or diagonals).\n\n4. **Symmetry and Combinations:** Use the symmetry of the circle to find all unique pairs. For example, \\((3, 4)\\) and \\((4, 3)\\) are different ordered pairs but represent the same point on the circle.\n\n5. **Verification:** Double-check the pairs found to ensure they satisfy the original equation and correctly calculate the sums to identify the maximum.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
