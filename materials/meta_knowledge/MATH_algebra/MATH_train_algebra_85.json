{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining the domain of a function based on transformations, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Transformations:** When a function is transformed, such as scaling by a factor, the domain of the new function can change. Specifically, if \\( g(x) = h\\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \\), the input to \\( h \\) is scaled by a factor of \\( \frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Scaling the Domain:** If the domain of \\( h(x) \\) is \\([-8, 8]\\), then the domain of \\( g(x) \\) will be scaled by the same factor. This means you need to multiply the endpoints of the domain of \\( h(x) \\) by 2 to find the domain of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n3. **Calculating the Width:** The width of the interval for the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is determined by the difference between the scaled endpoints. Ensure you perform the arithmetic correctly to find the exact width.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations for scaling the domain and computing the width to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can accurately determine the domain and its width for transformed functions."}
