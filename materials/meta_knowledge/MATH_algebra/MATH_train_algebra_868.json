{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have real roots, the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) must be non-negative. In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(c = 16\\), so \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 64 \\geq 0\\).\n\n2. **Solving Inequalities:** When solving inequalities like \\(b^2 - 64 \\geq 0\\), factorize the expression if possible (e.g., \\(b^2 - 64 = (b - 8)(b + 8)\\)) and determine the intervals where the inequality holds.\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** Express the solution in interval notation correctly. For example, if \\(b \\leq -8\\) or \\(b \\geq 8\\), the interval notation would be \\((-\\infty, -8] \\cup [8, \\infty)\\).\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Ensure that you include the boundary points (if the inequality is non-strict) in your solution set, as these values also satisfy the condition of having real roots.\n\n5. **Double-Check Solutions:** Verify that your intervals correctly represent all possible values of \\(b\\) that satisfy the condition of having at least one real root in the quadratic equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
