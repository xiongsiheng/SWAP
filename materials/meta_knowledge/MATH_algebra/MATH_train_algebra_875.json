{"Knowledge": "To solve this problem accurately, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly identify the distances involved and the costs associated with each mode of transportation. In this case, the distances are given as 3000 km and 3250 km, and the costs are $0.15 per km for buses and $100 booking fee plus $0.10 per km for airplanes.\n\n2. **Calculating Costs:** For airplane travel, calculate the total cost by adding the booking fee to the cost per kilometer multiplied by the distance. Ensure you use the correct distance for the segment of the trip you are calculating.\n\n3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** If needed, use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate any missing distances in the right-angled triangle formed by the cities A, B, and C.\n\n4. **Double-Checking Calculations:** Verify your calculations for the cost, especially when dealing with both the booking fee and the per-kilometer charge, to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Consistency in Units:** Ensure that all units are consistent and correctly used in your calculations, such as ensuring distances are in kilometers and costs are in dollars.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can minimize errors and accurately determine the cost to fly from A to B."}
