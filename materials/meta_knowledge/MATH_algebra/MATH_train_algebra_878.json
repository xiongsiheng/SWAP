{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Equation of a Line:** Recall that the equation of a line can be written in the slope-intercept form, \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n\n2. **Finding y-Intercepts:** To find the y-intercept \\( b \\) of a line given its slope \\( m \\) and a point \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) on the line, use the formula \\( b = y_1 - mx_1 \\).\n\n3. **x-Intercept Calculation:** The x-intercept of a line \\( y = mx + b \\) is found by setting \\( y = 0 \\) and solving for \\( x \\). This gives \\( x = -\frac{b}{m} \\).\n\n4. **Distance Between Points:** The distance between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by the formula \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\). However, since you're only interested in the x-intercepts, the distance simplifies to \\( |x_2 - x_1| \\).\n\n5. **Absolute Value:** When calculating the distance between the x-intercepts, use the absolute value to ensure the distance is positive, as distance cannot be negative.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
