{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring polynomials and solving for constants in factorized forms, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Factor by Grouping:** When factoring a quadratic expression like \\(3y^2 - y - 24\\), consider using the method of grouping. This involves finding two numbers that multiply to the product of the leading coefficient and the constant term, and whose sum is the coefficient of the linear term.\n\n2. **Product and Sum Properties:** For the expression \\((3y + a)(y + b)\\), the product \\(a \\cdot b\\) must equal the constant term of the original polynomial (-24 in this case), and the sum \\(3b + a\\) must equal the linear term's coefficient (-1).\n\n3. **Integer Solutions:** Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, use trial and error or systematic guessing to find suitable pairs of integers that satisfy both the product and sum conditions.\n\n4. **Verification of Factors:** Once you have identified potential values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), expand the factorized form \\((3y + a)(y + b)\\) to ensure it matches the original polynomial \\(3y^2 - y - 24\\).\n\n5. **Calculation of Difference:** After determining \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), calculate \\(a - b\\) directly, ensuring no arithmetic errors occur during this final step.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
