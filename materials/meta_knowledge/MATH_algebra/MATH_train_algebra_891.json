{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when expanding products like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Distributive Property:** Apply the distributive property correctly. Multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure correct calculation. Start by distributing the 3 to both binomials before expanding further.\n\n3. **Combining Like Terms:** After expanding, combine like terms to simplify the expression. Ensure that you correctly identify and combine all similar terms.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially multiplication and addition, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Work:** After completing the expansion, double-check each step to ensure accuracy. This includes verifying the distribution and combination of terms.\n\nThese guidelines will help ensure accuracy and minimize errors in expanding such products."}
