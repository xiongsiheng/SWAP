{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of a quadratic function at a specific point, consider the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Understand the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) and how it relates to the roots and vertex of the parabola.\n\n2. **Vertex Form:** Recognize that the vertex form of a quadratic function is \\(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex of the parabola.\n\n3. **Symmetry of Parabolas:** Utilize the symmetry property of parabolas. If you know the value of the function at two symmetric points around the vertex, you can infer the value at other points.\n\n4. **Graph Interpretation:** Analyze the given graph to determine key points such as the vertex, roots, or any specific points where the function value is known.\n\n5. **Substitution:** When calculating \\(q(15)\\), substitute \\(x = 15\\) into the quadratic equation and perform the arithmetic carefully to avoid calculation errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** If possible, verify your result by checking if the value is consistent with the graph or any other known points on the function.\n\nThese points will help minimize errors when determining the value of a quadratic function at a specific point."}
