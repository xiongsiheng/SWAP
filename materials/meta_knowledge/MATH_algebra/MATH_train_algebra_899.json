{"Knowledge": "To determine the range of a function and express it as an interval, consider the following points:\n\n1. **Analyze the Function:** Understand the behavior of the function \\( g(x) = \frac{2}{2+4x^2} \\). Notice that the denominator \\( 2 + 4x^2 \\) is always positive and has a minimum value of 2 (when \\( x = 0 \\)).\n\n2. **Determine the Minimum and Maximum Values:** As \\( x \\) varies, \\( 4x^2 \\) varies from 0 to infinity. Thus, \\( 2 + 4x^2 \\) varies from 2 to infinity. The function \\( g(x) \\) will take values from \\( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) (when \\( x = 0 \\)) to \\( \frac{2}{\\infty} \u0007pprox 0 \\).\n\n3. **Identify the Range:** The range of \\( g(x) \\) is therefore \\( (0, 1] \\). This means \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\( a + b \\):** Sum the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to find \\( a + b = 0 + 1 = 1 \\).\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the range of the function and compute the required sum."}
