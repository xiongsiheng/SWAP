{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Range:** The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. For a quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2 \\), the range is determined by the vertex and the direction of the parabola (upward or downward).\n\n2. **Vertex Form:** Recognize that the vertex of the parabola \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2 \\) is given by \\( x = -\frac{b}{2} \\). The y-coordinate of the vertex is \\( f\\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right) \\).\n\n3. **Completing the Square:** To find the minimum or maximum value of the function, you can complete the square or use the vertex formula directly.\n\n4. **Interval Notation:** When expressing the answer in interval notation, ensure that you correctly represent the intervals where the value \\(-2\\) is not included in the range.\n\n5. **Checking Boundaries:** Pay attention to whether the boundaries of the intervals are inclusive or exclusive, depending on whether the function achieves the value \\(-2\\) at the vertex or not.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
