{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the formula \\(\\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)\\). Ensure you correctly apply this formula.\n\n2. **Coordinate Addition and Division:** When calculating the midpoint, add the corresponding coordinates (x with x, y with y) and then divide by 2. Missteps often occur in these simple arithmetic operations.\n\n3. **Negative Coordinates:** Be cautious when dealing with negative coordinates. Adding or subtracting negative numbers can lead to errors if not handled carefully.\n\n4. **Double-Check Calculations:** After finding the midpoint, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy, especially in the division step.\n\n5. **Visualizing the Problem:** If possible, visualize or sketch the coordinates on a graph to help confirm the logic and calculations. This can provide a visual check on the reasonableness of your answer.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
