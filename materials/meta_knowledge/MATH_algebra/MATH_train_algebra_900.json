{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** Ensure you correctly interpret the equation, especially the use of square roots and the algebraic expressions involved. Recognize that the equation involves both linear and quadratic terms.\n\n2. **Simplifying Complex Expressions:** When dealing with complex expressions under square roots, simplify them step by step. For instance, simplify \\(\\sqrt{(2a)^2 + 1^2}\\) correctly.\n\n3. **Isolating Variables:** Aim to isolate the variable \\(a\\) by simplifying both sides of the equation. This might involve algebraic manipulation such as clearing fractions or simplifying radicals.\n\n4. **Checking for Extraneous Solutions:** When you manipulate the equation (e.g., by squaring both sides or multiplying through by a variable expression), you might introduce solutions that do not satisfy the original equation. Always verify your final answer by substituting it back into the original equation.\n\n5. **Maximizing \\(a\\):** Since the problem asks for the greatest \\(a\\), consider the constraints and behavior of the function as \\(a\\) increases. This might involve analyzing the limits or critical points of the expression.\n\n6. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Pay close attention to detail in your calculations, especially when dealing with square roots and fractions, as these operations are prone to error.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can minimize errors and improve your chances of solving the problem correctly."}
