{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding the Operator:** Clearly understand the definition of the custom operator $\\$$. In this case, it is defined as $a(b + 1) + ab$. Break down the expression into its components to ensure you apply the operator correctly.\n\n2. **Substitution:** When substituting values into the operator, ensure you substitute both $a$ and $b$ correctly. Double-check that you are using the correct values for $a$ and $b$ in the expression.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and multiplication. Errors in arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Simplification:** After substituting the values, simplify the expression step by step. Ensure that each step is logically correct and that you are not skipping any steps.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Once you have a final answer, it can be helpful to re-evaluate the expression with the given values to ensure that your answer is consistent with the problem's definition.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
