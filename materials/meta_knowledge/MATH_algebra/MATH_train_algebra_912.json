{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Ensure that you correctly translate the given conditions into mathematical equations. For example, if the difference between two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 9, you should write \\(a - b = 9\\). If the sum of the squares of these numbers is 153, you should write \\(a^2 + b^2 = 153\\).\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When solving pairs of simultaneous equations, be careful with your algebraic manipulations. For instance, you might need to express one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the second equation.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all your calculations, especially when squaring numbers and when adding or subtracting terms. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect solutions.\n\n4. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Utilize algebraic identities to simplify your work. For example, you might use the identity \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) or \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) to help solve the problem.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** After finding the values of the two numbers, calculate their product and verify that it satisfies the original conditions given in the problem. This step ensures that your solution is correct and that no errors were made during the solving process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
