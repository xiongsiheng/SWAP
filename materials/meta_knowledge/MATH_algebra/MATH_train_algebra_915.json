{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Geometric Sequence Formula:** Remember the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric sequence: \\( S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Identifying Terms:** Ensure you correctly identify the first term \\( a \\) and the common ratio \\( r \\) of the sequence. For the given sequence, \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( r = \frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** Substitute the known values into the sum formula to set up the equation \\( \frac{121}{81} = 1 \frac{1-(\frac{1}{3})^n}{1-\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Equation:** Simplify the equation carefully, ensuring that you correctly handle the fractions and exponents.\n\n5. **Solving for \\( n \\):** Isolate \\( n \\) by solving the equation. This may involve logarithms or other algebraic manipulations.\n\n6. **Double-Check Calculations:** Verify your calculations at each step to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n7. **Verification:** Substitute the calculated \\( n \\) back into the context of the problem to ensure the sum matches the given value.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
