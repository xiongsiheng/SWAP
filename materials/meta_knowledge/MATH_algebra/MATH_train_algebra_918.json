{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** Remember the midpoint formula for points \\(A(a, b)\\) and \\(B(c, d)\\) on the Cartesian plane is \\(M\\left(\frac{a+c}{2}, \frac{b+d}{2}\right)\\).\n\n2. **Coordinate Transformations:** When moving points, add or subtract the given units directly to the coordinates. For example, moving point \\(A(a, b)\\) vertically upwards by 8 units and horizontally to the right by 2 units results in the new coordinates \\(A'(a+2, b+8)\\).\n\n3. **Distance Formula:** Use the distance formula to find the distance between two points \\(M(m, n)\\) and \\(M'(m', n')\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{(m'-m)^2 + (n'-n)^2}\\).\n\n4. **Accuracy in Calculations:** Ensure precise calculations when updating coordinates and applying formulas to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Coordinates:** Verify the new coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) after their movements to ensure they are correct before calculating the new midpoint \\(M'\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
