{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Relatively Prime Numbers:** Relatively prime numbers have no common divisors other than 1. This means their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\n2. **Formulating Equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations. For this problem, you might use the equation \\(xy + x + y = 95\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the two integers.\n\n3. **Checking Bounds:** Since each integer is less than 20, consider all possible pairs of integers within this range.\n\n4. **Systematic Approach:** Use a systematic approach to test pairs of integers that are relatively prime and satisfy the equation. This can be done by iterating through possible values for one integer and solving for the other.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding a pair that satisfies the conditions, verify that they are indeed relatively prime and that their product plus their sum equals 95.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
