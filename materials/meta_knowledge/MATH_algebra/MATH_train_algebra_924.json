{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when finding the y-intercept of a line given in standard form or any other form, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Standard Form Conversion:** If the equation is in standard form (Ax + By = C), convert it to slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) by solving for y. This directly gives you the y-intercept (b).\n\n2. **Direct Substitution:** For the y-intercept, x is always 0. Substitute x = 0 into the equation and solve for y to find the intercept directly.\n\n3. **Check Calculations:** Ensure that you perform algebraic manipulations correctly, especially when isolating y. Simple arithmetic errors can lead to incorrect intercepts.\n\n4. **Graphical Verification:** Optionally, you can quickly sketch the line or use a graphing tool to visually confirm the y-intercept, which can help verify your algebraic solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while finding the y-intercept of a line."}
