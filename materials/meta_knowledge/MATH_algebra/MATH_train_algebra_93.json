{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Exponent Rules:** Familiarize yourself with the rules of exponents, particularly the product of powers rule \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) and the quotient of powers rule \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\).\n\n2. **Simplifying the Numerator and Denominator:** Identify patterns in the exponents of the numerator and denominator. For instance, recognize that the numerator consists of consecutive integers from 1 to 15, and the denominator consists of even integers from 2 to 20.\n\n3. **Calculating the Effective Exponent:** Determine the effective exponent by subtracting the sum of the exponents in the denominator from the sum of the exponents in the numerator. This can be simplified by recognizing the pattern of the series.\n\n4. **Substitution and Calculation:** After simplifying the exponent, substitute the given value of \\(x\\) into the simplified expression and calculate the result. Ensure that the calculations are done accurately to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n5. **Double-Check Calculations:** Always verify your calculations, especially when dealing with large exponents or complex series, to ensure that no mistakes have been made during the simplification process.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
