{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of linear equation, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Isolating Variables:** When solving for a variable, isolate it on one side of the equation. This typically involves adding or subtracting terms from both sides to consolidate the variable terms.\n\n2. **Simplifying Coefficients:** Ensure that you correctly handle coefficients and constants. For example, when dividing both sides by a coefficient to solve for the variable, make sure to divide every term by that coefficient.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check your arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with decimals, as these can be prone to calculation errors.\n\n4. **Verification:** Always substitute your final answer back into the original equation to ensure it works, as this step will catch most errors introduced during solving.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving linear equations."}
