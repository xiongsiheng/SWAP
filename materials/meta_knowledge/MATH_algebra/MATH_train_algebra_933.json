{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), which is used to find the solutions of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Roots:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots (solutions) is given by \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\). This is a direct consequence of Vieta's formulas.\n\n3. **Simplifying Equations:** Before applying the quadratic formula, simplify the given equation to the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) by combining like terms.\n\n4. **Checking the Form:** Ensure that the equation is in the correct form before applying the quadratic formula. The equation must be set to zero on one side.\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Be meticulous with arithmetic operations, especially when calculating with fractions or square roots, as these can lead to errors.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving quadratic equations and finding the sum of their solutions."}
