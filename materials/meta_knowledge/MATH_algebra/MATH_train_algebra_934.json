{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of a Quadratic:** The vertex form of a quadratic equation is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex of the parabola. For this problem, since the vertex is \\((-4, 0)\\), the equation can be written as \\( y = a(x + 4)^2 \\).\n\n2. **Substitution:** Use the given point \\((1, -75)\\) to substitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = -75\\) into the equation to solve for \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Simplification:** Ensure that you simplify the equation correctly after substitution. This involves expanding the squared term and then solving for \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and exponents, as these can lead to errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by substituting the value of \\(a\\) back into the equation and checking if the point \\((1, -75)\\) satisfies the equation.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
