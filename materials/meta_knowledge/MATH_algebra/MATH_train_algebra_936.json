{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when factoring expressions like this, consider the following:\n\n1. **Simplify First:** Combine like terms before attempting to factor. This simplifies the expression and makes factoring easier.\n\n2. **Common Factors:** Identify any common factors in all terms of the expression. Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) first.\n\n3. **Grouping Terms:** If the expression has four terms, consider grouping terms in pairs to facilitate factoring by grouping.\n\n4. **Perfect Squares and Cubes:** Be aware of patterns for perfect squares and cubes, as these can simplify the factoring process.\n\n5. **Double-Check Factoring:** After factoring, multiply the factors back together to ensure they correctly reproduce the original expression. This step helps catch any errors in the factoring process.\n\n6. **Negative Signs:** Pay careful attention to negative signs, especially when subtracting polynomials, as errors with signs are common.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can minimize errors and more accurately factor complex expressions."}
