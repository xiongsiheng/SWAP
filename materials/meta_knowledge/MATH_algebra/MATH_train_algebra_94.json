{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Discriminant Condition:** For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) to have exactly one real root, the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) must be equal to zero. In this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4m\\), and \\(c = m\\).\n\n2. **Solving for the Parameter:** Set the discriminant equal to zero and solve for the parameter \\(m\\). This involves solving a simple equation, but ensure you correctly isolate and solve for \\(m\\).\n\n3. **Positive Value Requirement:** Since the problem specifies finding the positive value of \\(m\\), ensure your solution for \\(m\\) is positive. This might involve checking the sign of your result or considering the context of the problem.\n\n4. **Verification:** Substitute your value of \\(m\\) back into the original quadratic equation to confirm that it indeed has exactly one real root. This step helps verify the correctness of your solution.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
