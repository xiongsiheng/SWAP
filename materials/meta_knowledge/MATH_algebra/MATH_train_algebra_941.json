{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope Formula:** Recall the formula for the slope of a line passing through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), which is given by \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Solving:** When substituting the given coordinates into the slope formula, ensure that you correctly substitute the values and solve for the unknown variable \\(y\\).\n\n3. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions, as these can lead to common mistakes.\n\n4. **Checking Your Answer:** After finding the value of \\(y\\), it is a good practice to verify your solution by substituting \\(y\\) back into the slope formula to ensure that the calculated slope matches the given slope.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
