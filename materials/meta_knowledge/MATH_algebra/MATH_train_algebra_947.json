{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Degrees of Polynomials:** The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, the degree of \\(3x^4 + 2x^2 + 1\\) is 4.\n\n2. **Degree of Composite Functions:** When dealing with composite functions, the degree of \\(f(g(x))\\) is the product of the degrees of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), provided that neither \\(f(x)\\) nor \\(g(x)\\) is a constant polynomial.\n\n3. **Degree of Sum of Polynomials:** The degree of the sum of two polynomials is the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials, unless the leading terms cancel each other out.\n\n4. **Applying Given Information:** Use the given degrees of \\(h(x)\\) and \\(f(x)\\) to set up an equation involving the degree of \\(g(x)\\). This will help you determine the degree of \\(g(x)\\) by solving the equation.\n\n5. **Verification:** After determining the degree of \\(g(x)\\), verify your solution by checking if the degree of \\(h(x)\\) matches the given information when substituting the degree of \\(g(x)\\) into the expression for \\(h(x)\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
