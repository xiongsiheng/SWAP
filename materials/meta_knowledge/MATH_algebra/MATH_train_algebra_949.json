{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Relationships:** Clearly identify the relationship between the ages given in the problem. In this case, the relationship is that Andrew's grandfather's age is twelve times Andrew's age.\n\n2. **Using Algebraic Equations:** Set up an algebraic equation based on the information provided. For instance, if Andrew's age is represented by \\( x \\), then his grandfather's age would be \\( 12x \\).\n\n3. **Accounting for Age Differences:** Consider the age difference between Andrew and his grandfather at the time of Andrew's birth. This information is crucial for setting up the correct equation.\n\n4. **Solving Equations:** Carefully solve the algebraic equation step by step, ensuring that each step is logically sound and that arithmetic operations are performed accurately.\n\n5. **Verification:** After finding the solution, verify it by substituting the value back into the original conditions to ensure it satisfies all given constraints.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
