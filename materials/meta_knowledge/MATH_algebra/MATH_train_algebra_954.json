{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** Understand the piecewise function definition clearly. Identify which part of the function to use based on the input value.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Apply the function operations step by step, starting from the innermost function and moving outward. Ensure each step correctly applies the appropriate part of the piecewise function.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions:** Be cautious when evaluating the function near the boundary (in this case, \\(x = 7\\)). Check whether the input satisfies the condition for the first or second part of the function.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Perform each arithmetic operation carefully, especially when squaring numbers or subtracting large values, to avoid simple calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** After calculating \\(f(f(f(17)))\\), consider verifying each step by recalculating or using a different method to ensure the correctness of each intermediate result.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
