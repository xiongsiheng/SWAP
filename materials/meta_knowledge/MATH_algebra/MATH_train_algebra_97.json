{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Setting Up Equations:** Translate the problem into mathematical equations accurately. For example, if Jim's weight is \\( J \\) and Bob's weight is \\( B \\), the first statement can be written as \\( J + B = 180 \\), and the second as \\( B - J = \frac{1}{2}B \\).\n\n2. **Solving Simultaneous Equations:** When solving for two variables using two equations, isolate one variable and substitute into the other equation. Ensure that the steps are logical and consistent.\n\n3. **Checking Calculations:** Double-check all arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions or divisions, as these are common areas for errors.\n\n4. **Substitution and Verification:** After finding the values of the variables, substitute them back into the original equations to verify that they satisfy both conditions.\n\n5. **Understanding the Problem:** Clearly understand what the problem is asking for. In this case, it's specifically asking for Bob's weight, so ensure your final answer reflects this.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
