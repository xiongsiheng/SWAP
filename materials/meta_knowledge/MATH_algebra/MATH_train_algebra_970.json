{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Organize Information:** Clearly list the relationships and ages given in the problem. This helps in visualizing the connections between the individuals.\n\n2. **Use Algebraic Equations:** If possible, translate the relationships into simple algebraic equations. For example, if Diana is three years younger than Eduardo, you can express this as \\( D = E - 3 \\).\n\n3. **Substitute Values:** Once you have the equations, substitute known values into the equations to find the unknowns. Ensure that each substitution is correct to avoid chain errors.\n\n4. **Check Calculations:** After finding a value, double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy. Simple arithmetic mistakes can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n5. **Verify Consistency:** Ensure that the ages and relationships are consistent with the initial conditions provided in the problem. This step helps in confirming that the solution is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving age-related problems."}
