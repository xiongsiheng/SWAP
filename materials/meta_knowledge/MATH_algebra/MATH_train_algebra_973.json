{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, consider the following:\n\n1. **Properties of Square Roots:** Utilize the property that \\(\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot b}\\) to simplify the product of square roots.\n\n2. **Simplification Techniques:** Combine the square roots under a single radical to simplify the expression. For example, \\(\\sqrt{8x} \\cdot \\sqrt{10x} \\cdot \\sqrt{3x} \\cdot \\sqrt{15x} = \\sqrt{(8x) \\cdot (10x) \\cdot (3x) \\cdot (15x)}\\).\n\n3. **Multiplication and Factorization:** Perform the multiplication inside the radical carefully, and look for common factors or ways to simplify the resulting expression.\n\n4. **Solving for \\(x\\):** Once you have simplified the equation to a form involving \\(x\\), isolate \\(x\\) and solve for its value. Ensure that the solution is consistent with the condition that \\(x\\) is a positive number.\n\n5. **Verification:** Substitute the value of \\(x\\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the given condition. This step is crucial to ensure that no arithmetic or simplification errors have occurred.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can minimize errors and accurately solve for \\(x\\)."}
