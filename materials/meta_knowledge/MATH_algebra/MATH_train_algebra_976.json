{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Quadratic Inequalities:** Recognize that a quadratic inequality \\(ax^2 + bx + c < 0\\) has real solutions for \\(x\\) if and only if the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) has two distinct real roots.\n\n2. **Discriminant Analysis:** For the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) must be positive for the equation to have two distinct real roots. This is crucial for determining the conditions under which the inequality holds.\n\n3. **Interval Notation:** When expressing the solution in interval notation, ensure that you correctly identify the intervals where the quadratic expression is negative. This involves understanding the parabola's orientation (upward or downward) and the positions of the roots.\n\n4. **Checking Boundaries:** Be cautious with the boundaries of the intervals. The inequality \\(x^2 - 6x + c < 0\\) does not include the points where the quadratic expression equals zero.\n\n5. **Graphical Representation:** Optionally, sketching the graph of the quadratic function can help visualize where the function is negative, aiding in the correct interpretation of the inequality.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
