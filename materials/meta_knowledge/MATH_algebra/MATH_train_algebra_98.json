{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when determining where a rational expression is undefined, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify Denominator Zeros:** A rational expression is undefined at values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero. Therefore, you need to find the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation \\( (x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3) = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Factorization:** Factor the denominator completely to identify all possible values of \\( x \\). For example, \\( x^2 + 2x - 3 \\) can be factored into \\( (x + 3)(x - 1) \\).\n\n3. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Be careful not to cancel common factors in the numerator and denominator prematurely, as this can lead to overlooking values where the expression is undefined.\n\n4. **Check Each Factor:** Ensure that each factor in the denominator is set to zero and solve for \\( x \\). This will give you all the values where the expression is undefined.\n\n5. **Count Distinct Solutions:** After finding the values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero, count these values to determine how many distinct points the expression is undefined.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
