{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution of Coordinates:** When given a point of intersection, substitute the coordinates of the point into both equations to form a system of equations. In this case, substitute \\(x = 6\\) and \\(y = 10\\) into both \\(y = mx + 4\\) and \\(y = 3x + b\\).\n\n2. **System of Equations:** From the substitution, you will obtain two equations involving \\(m\\) and \\(b\\). Solve this system of equations simultaneously to find the values of \\(m\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Careful Arithmetic:** Pay close attention to the arithmetic operations during substitution and solving the system of equations, as errors in calculation can lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Verification:** After solving for \\(m\\) and \\(b\\), you can verify your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations to ensure the point (6, 10) satisfies both.\n\n5. **Summing Constants:** Once you have determined \\(m\\) and \\(b\\), simply add them together to find \\(b + m\\).\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
