{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Vertical Asymptotes:** Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. For \\( f(x) = \frac{x+4}{x^2 + ax + b} \\), the vertical asymptotes at \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) imply that \\( x^2 + ax + b \\) must be zero at these points.\n\n2. **Formulating the Denominator:** Since \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) are roots of the denominator, you can express the denominator as \\( (x - 1)(x + 2) \\). This factorization directly gives you the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + ax + b \\).\n\n3. **Expanding and Matching Coefficients:** Expand \\( (x - 1)(x + 2) \\) to get the quadratic form \\( x^2 + x - 2 \\). By comparing this with \\( x^2 + ax + b \\), you can determine the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum:** Once you have identified \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), simply add them together to find the required sum.\n\n5. **Double-Checking Your Work:** Ensure that your factorization and expansion steps are correct, and verify that the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) indeed create the correct quadratic equation that has roots at \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\nThese steps will help you accurately determine the sum of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) while minimizing errors."}
