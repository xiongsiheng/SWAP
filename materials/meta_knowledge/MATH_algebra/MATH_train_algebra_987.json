{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving for the value of \\( c \\) in a quadratic equation given its roots, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Recall the quadratic formula \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). This formula gives the roots of the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Matching Coefficients:** When you have the roots in the form \\( x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), match the coefficients with those of the given quadratic equation to ensure consistency.\n\n3. **Discriminant:** The term under the square root in the quadratic formula, \\( b^2 - 4ac \\), is called the discriminant. Ensure that the discriminant matches the given roots' form.\n\n4. **Substitution:** Substitute the given roots back into the quadratic formula to verify that they satisfy the equation and to find the value of \\( c \\).\n\n5. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with fractions and square roots, as these can lead to calculation errors.\n\n6. **Verification:** Always verify your final value of \\( c \\) by substituting it back into the original quadratic equation and checking if the roots match the given form.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving for \\( c \\) in such problems."}
