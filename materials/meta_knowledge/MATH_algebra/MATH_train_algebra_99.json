{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Slope Calculation:** Ensure you correctly calculate the slope of the line using the formula \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the given points.\n\n2. **Equation of a Line:** Use the point-slope form of the line equation, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), to derive the equation of the line. Substitute one of the given points and the calculated slope into this formula.\n\n3. **Intercept Calculation:** To find where the line intersects the y-axis, set \\(x = 0\\) in the line equation and solve for \\(y\\). This will give you the y-intercept.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers and fractions, as these can lead to calculation errors.\n\n5. **Verification:** Optionally, you can verify your solution by substituting the x-coordinate of the other given point into the derived line equation and ensuring it yields the correct y-coordinate.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
