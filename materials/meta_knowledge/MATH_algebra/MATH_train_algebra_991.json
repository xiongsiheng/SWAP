{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when evaluating expressions with given values, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Substitution Accuracy:** Ensure that you substitute the given values for the variables correctly. Double-check that you have replaced each variable with the correct number.\n\n2. **Order of Operations:** Follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when simplifying the expression after substitution. This includes performing multiplication before subtraction.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Precision:** Pay close attention to arithmetic operations, especially when dealing with negative numbers or zero, as these can lead to common mistakes.\n\n4. **Simplification Steps:** Clearly and methodically simplify the expression step by step to avoid confusion or errors in calculation.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Optionally, you can re-evaluate the expression with the given values to confirm that your final answer is correct.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while evaluating expressions with specific values."}
