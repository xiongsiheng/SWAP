{"Knowledge": "To reduce errors when solving this type of problem, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Identify the Range of Numbers:** Clearly define the range of numbers you are working with. In this case, the positive even integers less than 15 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n\n2. **Formulate the Expression:** Understand the mathematical expression you need to evaluate. Here, it is the sum of two numbers added to their product, which can be written as \\(a + b + ab\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the two numbers.\n\n3. **Systematic Pairing:** Pair each number with every other number (including itself) within the defined range to ensure you consider all possible combinations.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:** Be careful not to count the same result twice. For example, \\(2 + 4 + 2 \\cdot 4\\) and \\(4 + 2 + 4 \\cdot 2\\) yield the same result.\n\n5. **Check for Unique Values:** After calculating each combination, list and count the unique results to determine the number of different possible values.\n\n6. **Verification:** Double-check your calculations and the uniqueness of your results to ensure accuracy.\n\nThese points should help minimize mistakes while solving such problems."}
